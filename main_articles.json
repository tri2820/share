    "maintext": "LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry’s historic showdown Tuesday with the publisher of a British tabloid exposed his deep suspicions of the press but offered little concrete evidence to support accusations of phone hacking that he said caused so much anguish in his life.\nThe Duke of Sussex became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century as he held a Bible in his right hand and, in a soft voice, swore to tell the “whole truth and nothing but the truth” in the High Court in London.\nHarry accuses the publisher of the Daily Mirror of using unlawful techniques on an “industrial scale” to score front-page scoops on his life.\nDressed in a dark suit and tie as he sat in the witness box, Harry told Mirror Group Newspapers attorney Andrew Green that he had “experienced hostility from the press since I was born.” The prince accused the tabloids of playing “a destructive role in my growing-up.”\nGreen apologized for the one instance Mirror Group has admitted to hiring a private investigator to dig up dirt on Harry, which was not among the claims he has brought. Mirror Group denies or doesn’t admit his other allegations.\nGreen acknowledged that the duke had “lived a life of tabloid life intrusion,” and then in a sympathetic tone set about dismantling his case.\nTaken back in time to his 12th birthday and onward through early adulthood, he was confronted with articles that he has complained about and asked to identify the source of wrongdoing by Mirror Group’s journalists.\nHarry was forced almost immediately to acknowledge that he wasn’t certain he read the 33 specific articles about him when they were published.\n“Is it realistic, when you have been the subject of so much press intrusion by so many press, both domestic and international, to attribute specific distress to a particular article from 20 years ago, which you may not have seen at the time?” Green asked.\n“It isn’t a specific article; it is all of the articles,” Harry said. “Every single article has caused me distress.”\nHe suggested the articles were the result of phone hacking or some other unlawful information gathering method that “desperate journalists” relied on for any news nugget about his life.\nThe 38-year-old son of King Charles III is the first senior British royal since the 19th century to face questioning in a court. An ancestor, the future King Edward VII, appeared as a witness in a trial over a gambling scandal in 1891.\nHarry has said the royal family avoided legal entanglements to prevent having to be put in the witness box.\nThe case dates from 1996 to 2011 — a period when phone hacking by tabloid journalists was later discovered to have been widespread. It led to revelations of more intrusive means such as phone tapping, home bugging and using deception to obtain flight information and medical records.\nHarry’s fury at the U.K. press runs through his memoir, “Spare.” He blames paparazzi for causing the car crash that killed his mother, and said intrusion by the U.K. press, including allegedly racist articles, led him and his wife, Meghan, to flee to the U.S. in 2020 and leave royal life behind.\nWhen pressed to be specific about what information had been illegally harvested, Harry repeatedly told the lawyer that the source of information in stories was “highly suspicious” or that he should ask the reporter who wrote the article.\nHe said some of the journalists had been known for hacking or that there were invoices to third parties, including private investigators known for snooping, around the time of the articles. He suggested other records had been destroyed.\nTime and again, as Green laid out evidence to the contrary and what was described by Harry as a nefarious act had a more innocent explanation.\nThe source of a 1996 story that mentioned how badly he was taking his parents’ divorce appeared to have come from public comments his mother, the late Princess Diana, had given to reporters.\nInformation about his 18th birthday came from his own mouth and, apparently, palace press people who set up an interview with him and the Press Association, which was widely used or quoted in many papers, including the Daily Mirror.\nA Daily Mirror story headlined “Snap, Harry breaks thumb like William” in 2000 came from a spokesperson at his father’s office, which had given the Press Association the news the day before.\nHarry remained steadfast that the paper’s former royal editor, Jane Kerr, who is due to testify Wednesday, relied on some unlawful means to report the story.\n“Probably herself or she got someone else to do her dirty work for her,” he said.\nWhen asked whose phone she hacked, Harry suggested it could have been the doctor’s.\n“Are you not in the realms of total speculation?” Green said.\n“No, I do not believe so,” Harry said.\nHarry said the articles caused him to become depressed and paranoid, distrustful of friends, who he feared were feeding information to the media. His circle of friends shrank, relationships fell apart and he felt constantly in the glare of the journalists who were shaping the narrative of his life.\n“I genuinely feel that in every relationship that I’ve ever had — be that with friends, girlfriends, with family or with the army, there’s always been a third party involved, namely the tabloid press,” Harry said in a written witness statement released Tuesday.\nSetting out the prince’s case, his lawyer, David Sherborne, said Monday that from Harry’s childhood, British newspapers used skullduggery to cover all facets of his life — from school injuries to experimenting with marijuana and cocaine, to ups and downs with girlfriends.\n“Nothing was sacrosanct or out of bounds” for the tabloids, the lawyer said.\nGreen said Monday that there was “simply no evidence capable of supporting the finding that the Duke of Sussex was hacked, let alone on a habitual basis.”\nMirror Group has paid more than 100 million pounds ($125 million) to settle hundreds of unlawful information-gathering claims and printed an apology to phone hacking victims in 2015.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It's free, has a Linux version and got the attention of Tetris Holding, LLC under the previous name Setris so it got a DMCA takedown but now it's back. But for how long?\nThe original page on itch.io for Setris is gone and just has a link to the copyright complaint from Tetris Holdings, because the Setris name was so similar (and it noted the use of a \"Russian Folk Song Registered Trademark\") on top of that. So the developer has renamed it to Sandtrix and put it back up. I wasn't even aware of it until now thanks to the DMCA so it's actually given it a bit of a boost.\nQuite a fun spin on the basic idea of falling blocks. They come down in the usual shapes, but when they hit the bottom or some sand already there, they crumble into pieces. You need to cover an entire row from left to right in one colour to have it vanish and up your score. Really sweet to kill a few minutes.\nHead to the itch.io page to check it out.\nLooking around it probably got the attention of Tetris Holding because Kotaku and RPS both covered it recently when it was called Setris. So they must have people constantly looking around for anything resembling Tetris to strike.",

    "maintext": "India’s former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi said the “possibility of sabotage” behind the triple train crash in Odisha’s Balasore cannot be ruled out.\nOn June 2, the Coromandel Express had crashed into a stationary goods train, derailing most of its coaches at 7 pm. A few coaches of the Coromandel toppled over the last few coaches of the Bengaluru-Howrah express which was passing by at the same time in the opposite direction, turning it into a devastating triple train crash.\nAt least 275 people died and around 1,200 others were injured in the accident.\n“The inputs and understanding I have about the interlocking system, its functioning, and what happened in the incident, I felt that there was a serious manipulation which led the Coromandel Express on the loop line from the main track. Now with more findings coming up, I am more than 100% sure that this crash was caused by sabotage and not a mere accident,” Trivedi told News18.\nHe further stated that the signal was green, and it is impossible for the interlocking system to malfunction like this.\n“In a railway system, so many coincidences do not happen. If an interlocking system at any point fails or goes haywire, there is another system that comes into force. It is called ‘fail-safe’. If fail-safe gets activated, then all signals on the specific track turn red, and the train won’t move,” the former minister said.\nFurther, he called the series of incidents that happened around 7 pm on Friday on the tracks near Bahanaga Bazar a “meticulous conspiracy” and added, “To me, it seems like extensive planning and calculation leading to such incidents happening one after another in a matter of a few seconds.”\nTrivedi said the goods train loaded with iron-ore standing like a rock, and a passenger train hitting it on a loop line is not a case of usual signal failure or derailment.\n“We must understand that a loco pilot can only press a brake or accelerate the train speed depending on the signals. The loco pilot cannot change track or divert trains. So, the train changed track and went on the loop line from the main line on its own after the system was manipulated from the inside. Had it been a simple case of signal failure or malfunctioning of the interlocking system, the train could never change track so smoothly. Because, with system failure, the tracks get blocked automatically and signals turn red,” he told News18.\nThe former minister also rubbished the theories given by Opposition politicians for calling Railways an “ill-maintained system” and questioned the non-availability of the anti-collision Kavach mechanism.\n“West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also experienced such an incident of sabotage when Jnaneswari Express rammed into a derailed goods train in West Midnapore district in 2010. She handed over the investigation to the CBI and asked the CPI(M) not to indulge in politics. However, she is now being forgetful and repeating similar things CPI(M) did then,” he said.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News,\nIndia News and Entertainment News here.

    "maintext": "Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump are finally both in the presidential race and sparring daily over their records, leadership style, and name pronunciation. But as the two heavyweights look to differentiate each other, Nikki Haley is trying to convince GOP voters they’re one and the same.\nThe former South Carolina governor is trying to carve out a lane by arguing that — both on policy and style — DeSantis isn’t a big enough leap from Trump for Republicans disinclined to hand the former president a third nomination.\nOne prime example? DeSantis’ ongoing legal and political battle with Disney over the company’s criticism of a law restricting classroom discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation.\nDuring her CNN town hall on Sunday, Haley seemed to link it to Trump’s feuds, arguing the company had taken liberal stances in the past on issues like immigration, but that DeSantis only turned on them when criticized personally.\n“It’s just like all this vendetta stuff,” Haley said. “We’ve been down that road.” (DeSantis hit back on Monday afternoon during a Fox News appearance.)\nAD\nHaley’s team has been laying the groundwork for this idea — binding the top two candidates together as one in an effort to best DeSantis as the main non-Trump alternative — for weeks now. At the same town hall, she slammed both candidates over their unwillingness to clearly say whether they want Ukraine to beat out Russia.\n“For them to sit there and say that this is a territorial dispute, that’s just not the case — or to say that we should stay neutral,” Haley said. “It’s in the best interest of our national security for Ukraine to win.”\nJust days before DeSantis’ campaign launch, Haley’s team also sent out a memo to “interested parties” that argued against DeSantis’ pitch as the more grown-up “credible alternative” to Trump. “Not ‘Trump Without the Drama.’ Just ‘Mini-Trump,’” Haley’s team declared, pointing to recent leaks of internal debate prep footage from DeSantis’ 2018 race, as well as a Florida congressional lawmaker noting that he declined to endorse DeSantis in part because he couldn’t get a call back.",

    "maintext": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nWall Street is relatively flat Monday following last week’s last surge propelled by U.S. jobs data that raised new questions about if or when a recession might arrive. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are essentially unchanged heading into a week with little new data expected from major U.S. corporations or economic indicators from Washington.\nEnergy prices are rising after Saudi Arabia said it will cut output by 1 million barrels per day to support sagging prices. But gasoline prices in the U.S. remain far below where they were at this point last year, according to price checker GasBuddy.\nThe average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. on Monday was $3.51, down $1.35 at this point in 2022, and down 4 cents from last week. Last year at this time, the cost for a barrel of oil was approaching $120.\nAdvertisement\nWall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index leapt 1.5% Friday after government data showed employers hired more people than expected in May. That suggests the economy is strong despite repeated rate increases to cool inflation.\nWage gains slowed, suggesting pressure for prices to rise might be weakening. That would reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to cool business activity with more rate hikes.\n“Markets appear poised to ride last week’s upward momentum as bubbly risk appetite finds a comfort pillow in hopes for a U.S. soft landing,” said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management in a report.\nAt midday in Europe, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.2% and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.1% the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.1%.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 2.2% to 32,217.43 and the Shanghai Composite Index added less than 0.1% to 3,232.44. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.7% to 19,089.47.\nAdvertisement\nThe Kospi in Seoul was 0.5% higher at 2,615.41 and the S&P ASX 200 in Sydney jumped 1% to 7,216.30.\nIndia’s Sensex opened up 0.5% at 62,844.36. Singapore and Jakarta gained. Markets in New Zealand and Thailand were closed for holidays.\nOn Friday, the Dow rallied 2.1% and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.1%.\nThe Labor Department’s monthly jobs report showed a slowdown in wage increases even though hiring strengthened. While that may discourage workers who are trying to keep up with rising prices, investors believe slower wage gains will mean less upward pressure on inflation.\nU.S. unemployment also rose by more than expected last month, moving up to 3.7% from a five-decade low. That implies more slack in the job market and seems to conflict with hiring data, which come from a separate survey.\nFollowing the report, traders were largely expecting the Fed to hold interest rates steady at this month’s meeting. That would be the first time it hasn’t hiked rates in more than a year.\nAdvertisement\nFed officials have also warned a pause on rate hikes at this month’s meeting won’t necessarily mean the end to increases this year.\nIn energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.82 to $73.56 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained $1.64 on Friday to $71.74. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, advanced $1.80 to $77.93 per barrel in London. It added $1.85 the previous session to $76.13.\nThe dollar rose to 140.23 yen from Friday’s 139.94 yen. The euro fell to $1.0689 from $1.0712.\n——\nMcDonald reported from Beijing; Ott reported from Silver Spring, Md.\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "maintext": "Lily-Rose Depp as Jocelyn. Photograph by Eddy Chen / Courtesy HBO\nMinutes into the first episode of “The Idol,” on HBO, the series offers a rejoinder to the controversy surrounding its supposed degradation of its young female protagonist. Lily-Rose Depp, who plays a fallen pop star, Jocelyn, is cycling through emotions on cue for an album-cover shoot—her first since suffering a psychotic break the year prior. Crew members flit in and out of the frame, adjusting Jocelyn’s hair and makeup; the rest of her team look on, debating the implications of the hospital bracelet around her wrist. “Are we romanticizing mental illness?” her creative director, Xander (Troye Sivan), asks. “Absolutely,” a label exec, Nikki (Jane Adams), replies, cheerfully brisk. “Will you let people enjoy sex, drugs, and hot girls?”\nJocelyn herself is determined to show off her figure; when an officious intimacy coördinator attempts to enforce the nudity rider in her contract, he’s locked in a bathroom for his troubles. “It’s my body,” she says, insisting that she’s comfortable posing nipples-out. “I don’t feel pressured.”\nHer assertions echo Depp’s own after the series premièred at the Cannes Film Festival, where the actress made a case for Jocelyn’s near-constant nudity. “The occasional bareness of the character physically mirrors the bareness that we get to see emotionally,” Depp explained. “I’ve never felt more involved in those kinds of conversations.”\nShe defended “The Idol” ’s showrunner, Sam Levinson, in the face of questions about Rolling Stone’s reporting on the chaotic production process, which apparently involved a shift away from “the female perspective” at the behest of its co-creator, Abel Tesfaye, a.k.a. the Weeknd; the rewritten scripts were decried as “torture porn.”\nLevinson—best known as the creator of “Euphoria,” which has also come under fire for objectifying its female leads—was more philosophical, and more oblique, in response to the critiques. “We know we are making a show that’s provocative,” he said, sitting between a smiling Depp and Tesfaye at a press conference. Levinson didn’t agree with how he was characterized in the Rolling Stone piece, in which a crew member described his version of “The Idol” as a “rape fantasy,” but he also claimed not to mind. “There’s two jobs in this business: there’s the work, and then there’s the managing of a persona,” he said. “Managing a persona is not interesting to me, because it takes away the time and energy that I would spend on the work.”\nThis duality is at the heart of “The Idol,” a six-episode series that splits its time between the apparatus around Jocelyn—the fleet of managers, publicists, assistants, executives, and lawyers tasked with making her palatable to the masses again, after the mental-health crisis that derailed her career—and the star’s private struggle to produce art that she can stand behind. The former plotline is a dark comedy about the celebrity-industrial complex; the latter is a melodrama that mostly involves Jocelyn smoking tremulously and making eyes at a club manager, Tedros (Tesfaye), with whom she begins an unfortunate affair. As the season goes on (the second episode, which I screened at Cannes, will air on Sunday evening), Jocelyn’s sound shifts under his influence, and it emerges that Tedros, who considers pop music “the ultimate Trojan horse,” has collected a number of gifted acolytes. If the purpose of the group remains obscure, their devotion to their leader is beyond dispute. “He’s godly,” one follower says in Episode 2, shortly after Tedros compels him to sing with a shock collar.\nAt the end of the pilot, Tedros “helps” Jocelyn find her voice in similarly sadomasochistic fashion, covering her face with her silk robe, lightly tightening the belt around her neck, and using a pocketknife to cut out a mouth hole before incorporating their breath-play into a more risqué version of her new single. The remix is as cringey as the sex scene that engendered it.\nThe seeds of “The Idol” were reportedly planted when Tesfaye told Levinson, “If I wanted to start a cult, I could”—but his powers of seduction are the least convincing thing about the series, not helped by such anatomically confused lines as “I want to grab you by the ass and suffocate you with my cock.”\nEven the characters in Tedros’s thrall suffer from a kind of cognitive dissonance, admitting more than once that their attraction to him is inexplicable. (“I’ve never fucked anyone with a rattail before,” Jocelyn tells him, mid make-out, after the two grind on the dance floor to Madonna’s “Like a Prayer.”) The camera’s leering interest in Depp compounds this imbalance: she strips down repeatedly, but he remains fully clothed. It’s unclear why Jocelyn would ever fall for him, or why characters played by stars with markedly greater stage presence, like the singer-songwriter Moses Sumney and the rapper Jennie Kim, from the Korean girl group Blackpink, would be pulled into his orbit. It might have made more sense to cast Tesfaye as another musician, but denying him his greatest asset was a deliberate choice. As Levinson said at Cannes, “What if this character had all of the dreams that Abel has, all of the vision that he has about culture. . . . but what if he had none of the talent?”\nTesfaye’s lack of charisma is only made starker by strong performances from the likes of Rachel Sennott as Leia, Jocelyn’s confidant and assistant (one of the first to see through Tedros’s act, saying, “I hate his vibe—he’s so rapey”), and Adams as the battle-hardened Nikki, who has no compunctions about treating Jocelyn as an expendable commodity. The show is at its best when the team trade barbed remarks and comeback strategies, which include positioning Jocelyn within a lineage of female artists who have been brutalized by the press. (Fiona Apple plays in the background during a photo shoot; Britney Spears is invoked by name.) As they tiptoe around their still fragile star, the question of which experiences can be made empowering—or at the very least marketable—looms large. When a selfie of Jocelyn, her face slicked with cum, becomes the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter, Nikki declares, “Tomorrow, I want to wake up to, like, a hundred and fifty Google alerts telling me Jocelyn’s some kind of feminist hero.” Jocelyn’s publicist (Dan Levy), who has just reluctantly agreed to treat the image as revenge porn, looks harried. “Yeah, me, too—but I’m gonna start with ‘victim’ and move up from there.”\nSo far, “The Idol” ’s view of Jocelyn has yet to progress beyond the “victim” phase. For all her talk of wanting to create something real, we have no sense of her artistry or ambitions outside of a focus-grouped single and some pointedly Britney-esque choreography, which is performed flawlessly by Kim—whose character, Dyanne, is one of Jocelyn’s backup dancers—while Jocelyn appears to struggle with it. (“God, I wish I could dance like you,” Jocelyn tells her.) The emphasis throughout is on the starlet’s body and her self-destructive streak, evidenced by a taste for slim cigarettes and erotic asphyxiation; her kinky hookups with Tedros are wince-inducing but hardly scandalizing in the way that the show intends them to be.\nEven so, a stylishly shot, faintly sordid project can prove compulsive for some. Though Levinson disputed the details of the Rolling Stone story, his ultimate response was of the all-press-is-good-press variety: it seemed he’d achieved the provocation he wanted, if not in the manner he might have expected. As he recalled at Cannes, “When my wife read me the article, I looked at her, and I just said, ‘I think we’re about to have the biggest show of the summer.’ ” For better or for worse, he may be right. ♦",

    "maintext": "When a computer crashes, it usually doesn’t leave debris. But when a computer happens to be descending towards the lunar surface and glitches out, that’s a very different story. Turns out that’s what happened on April 26th, as the Japanese Hakuto-R Lunar lander made its mark on the Moon…by crashing into it. [Scott Manley] dove in to try and understand the software bug that caused an otherwise flawless mission to go splat.\nThe lander began the descent sequence as expected at 100 km above the surface. However, as it descended, the altitude sensor reported the altitude as much lower than it was. It thought it was at zero altitude once it reached about 5 km above the surface. Confused by the fact it hadn’t yet detected physical contact with the surface, the craft continued to slowly descend until it ran out of fuel and plunged to the surface.\nUltimately it all came down to sensor fusion. The lander merges several noisy sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and radar, into one cohesive source of truth. The craft passed over a particularly large cliff that caused the radar altimeter to suddenly spike up 3 km. Like good filtering software, the craft reasons that the sensor must be getting spurious data and filters it out. It was now just estimating its altitude by looking at its acceleration. As anyone who has tried to track an object through space using just gyros and accelerometers alone can attest, errors accumulate, and suddenly you’re not where you think you are.\nWe know what you’re thinking: surely they would have run landing simulations to catch errors like these? Ironically they did, it’s just that after the simulations were run, the landing site for Hakuto-R was changed. Unfortunately, nobody thought to re-run the simulations, and now the Moon has a new lawn ornament,\nWe’ve previously written about why lunar landings are so hard. While knowing what led to the crash will hopefully prevent a similar fate for future missions, the reality is that remotely landing a robot on a dusty world without the help of GPS is fiendishly difficult and likely will be for some time.",

    "maintext": "Exports rankings have been greatly influenced by political and economic changes between 1991 and 2021. For instance, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to significant changes in the export profiles of its successor states. Additionally, the accession of new countries to the European Union has affected the rankings of some European nations.\nAs a result, over the past three decades, the ranking of major exporting countries has changed multiple times due to shifts in global trade dynamics, economic growth, and industry changes.\nOne of the most significant changes has been the rise of China as the world’s largest exporter. Over the past few decades, China’s manufacturing capabilities, low labor costs, and large domestic market have led to tremendous growth in its export sector.\nThe economies of South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, known as the “Asian Tigers,” have also undergone quick industrialization and growth driven by exports. These countries have developed strong export sectors in electronics, automobiles, and high-tech goods.\nCountries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia have experienced export growth and have become important players in global trade. They have attracted foreign direct investment, developed strong manufacturing bases, and benefited from global value chains.\nGermany has maintained its position as one of the top exporting countries over the years. The country’s reputation for high-quality manufacturing, particularly in the automotive and machinery sectors, has contributed to its export success.\nThe ranking of North American countries has witnessed some changes. The United States has remained a prominent exporter, but its share of global exports has declined due to the growth of other countries. Meanwhile, Mexico has emerged as a significant exporting nation, particularly in the automotive, electronics, and manufacturing sectors.\nThe rankings of European countries also have seen some shifts. France and the United Kingdom have experienced fluctuations in their export rankings, while the Netherlands has consistently maintained a strong position due to its strategic location and well-developed logistics infrastructure.\nReddit user giteam visualized the change in the ranking of the largest exporting countries from 1990 to 2021.\nCountries with the largest exports in 1990\nThe largest exporters in 1990 were primarily major industrialized nations. Here is the rating of the countries with the largest exports during that time:\nUnited States: The United States was the world’s largest exporter in 1990. Its exports mainly consisted of manufactured goods, machinery, automobiles, aircraft, and agricultural products. Germany: Germany was a leading exporter of automobiles, machinery, chemicals, and engineering products. German-made goods were highly regarded for their quality and precision. Japan: Japan was renowned for its exports of automobiles, electronics, machinery, and consumer goods. It had a strong presence in the global market and was considered one of the major exporting nations. France: France was a significant exporter of aircraft, machinery, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and luxury goods. Its strong industrial base contributed to its export success. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom had a diverse range of exports, including manufactured goods, machinery, chemicals, and services. London’s position as a global financial hub also contributed to its export sector. Italy: Italy had a reputation for its exports of automobiles, machinery, fashion and luxury goods, and food products. Brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Armani contributed to its export profile. Netherlands: The Netherlands had a strong export sector, particularly in the areas of machinery, chemicals, petroleum products, and agricultural goods. The Port of Rotterdam played a crucial role in facilitating international trade. Canada: Canada’s exports primarily consisted of natural resources such as minerals, forestry products, and energy. It also exported machinery, automobiles, and agricultural products. Belgium: In 1990, the Belgian economy was characterized by a mix of traditional industries and a growing services sector. Belgium had a well-developed manufacturing base, particularly in sectors such as steel, chemicals, and automobiles. The country also had a strong presence in international trade, with significant exports of machinery, processed diamonds, and pharmaceutical products. Switzerland: The country had a highly developed and prosperous economy. Known for its banking and financial services sector, Switzerland was considered a global hub for wealth management. The country also had a strong manufacturing industry, particularly in precision instruments, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.\nCountries with the largest exports in 2021\nAccording to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, China exported a total of $3.6T, making it the number 1 exporter in the world. Here are the top 10 leading exporters in the world.",

    "maintext": "(NerdWallet) – “He’s my little ball of sunshine,” Mallory Bartels says of her 13-year-old Boston terrier, Buddha. With his shiny black coat and white spots on his paws that look like socks, Bartels describes him as a sweet pup with a playful personality.\nBuddha’s zest for life was apparent when he jumped off the couch in Bartels’ home near Seattle. The leap landed Buddha in urgent veterinary care with a ruptured disk and paralyzed legs that required spinal surgery.\nOn top of being “a bawling mess” at the vet, Bartels also received a vet bill for over $5,000. “I didn’t have savings or cash to pay for it,” she says.\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, Americans spent nearly $36 billion in veterinary care, surgical procedures, medication and other products through vet clinics in 2022. The APPA expects that number to increase by $1 billion in 2023.\nHow do pet owners pay for emergency pet care? Here are options plus tips to prepare when Fido or Fluffy takes a tumble and needs urgent help.\nWays to pay for emergency pet care\nSavings\nSavings is one of the best ways to pay for emergency vet care, says John Boyd, a certified financial planner and the founder of MDRN Wealth in Scottsdale, Arizona. He suggests clients have an emergency fund that totals three to six months of living expenses and includes money for pet care.\nThe type of pet can influence how much to put away. “If you’re like me and you have a Great Dane, and they’re prone to stomach issues that could cost up to $2,000, factor that into the equation when it comes to how much to save,” Boyd says.\nVet financing plans\nMany vets and pet clinics offer financing plans, typically through a third party that partners with the vet. Some plans offer 0% interest financing and a quick approval process. Read the fine print to check the interest rate on the plan, and note that approval may require a hard credit check that will cause your score to dip a few points.\nCareCredit Card\nCareCredit is a financing option that specifically covers health care expenses for your family, including pets. You can apply online, and CareCredit typically offers 0% interest for six, 12, 18 or 24 months for expenses of $200 or more. However, if you don’t repay the full amount by the end of the promotional period, you’ll be charged interest retroactively from your original charge date.\nBartels used an existing CareCredit credit card to pay the vet bill for Buddha’s surgery. Because the account was already open, Bartels was outside the initial 0% interest period. She understood she’d be charged interest on the vet bill she put on CareCredit.\nCredit cards\nA credit card can be a convenient way to pay for emergency veterinary care if you have the available credit. However, credit card rates can be high, so paying off any accrued balance as soon as possible is important to avoid high-interest charges.\nTo save on interest, Bartels transferred her CareCredit balance to a credit card with a 0% annual percentage rate for 12 months. She paid a balance transfer fee, which was offset by the savings in interest. She had to add the monthly payments to her household budget, but the balance transfer card gave Bartels breathing room to pay it off.\nPet loans\nBanks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans that can help pay for unexpected veterinary expenses. Personal loans typically have interest rates from 6% to 36% and two- to seven-year repayment periods. Depending on how much you qualify for, loans start at $1,000 and go up to $50,000 or more. For quick cash, such as in the case of a pet emergency, some lenders provide next-day funding.\nFor borrowers with strong credit, a personal loan may have a lower interest rate than a credit card to pay large vet bills. A shorter loan term can mean higher monthly payments but less total interest cost. Use a personal loan calculator to estimate monthly payments based on the rate and term.\nLocal animal welfare organizations\nAnimal welfare organizations in your local area can be another option for caring for your pet. These organizations typically provide services at a lower cost than a regular vet, thanks to private funding and donations.\nRegarding pet care, “we understand that not everybody has the money all the time, and we try to meet people halfway,” says Erin Johnson, clinic manager for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nIn addition to preventive care, vet assistants at the SPCA offer a minor-needs clinic for pets that are feeling unwell, have an infection, are in minor pain or need an X-ray.\nWhile the SPCA can help with minor injuries, Johnson recommends knowing where your nearest urgent care vet is in case of a major accident. “Have a relationship with a full-service vet so that when something does go wrong, you have somebody to go to,” Johnson says.\nWhat about pet insurance?\nSigning up for new pet insurance won’t help if you’re uninsured in an emergency, but depending on the plan and provider, pet insurance can cover a future accident.\nBoyd says pet insurance can make sense if you don’t have enough emergency funds or if you have cash flow but not savings. In that situation, monthly premium payments can help provide coverage and peace of mind if something happens to your pet.\nOn the other hand, if you have savings for pet emergencies, “I would ditch the pet insurance and just self-insure, essentially,” Boyd says.\nBuddha back in action\n“He’s just been like a little pillar in my life,” says Bartels, who was relieved to have Buddha home after his operation. Although his spinal surgery was successful, the costs didn’t end. Bartels bought an orthopedic bed for Buddha to recuperate more comfortably and stairs to make it easier for him to go up or down from furniture.\nHaving learned the hard way about sudden emergency bills, Bartels opened a separate checking account for Buddha’s expenses. She deposits money monthly and uses the checking account’s debit card to pay for vet trips, food and other Buddha-related purchases.\n“It helps me feel more comfortable that if we were put in the situation again, we’d at least have a cash buffer to help us out,” Bartels says.",

    "maintext": "Some of Reddit’s biggest communities including r/videos, r/reactiongifs, r/earthporn, and r/lifeprotips are planning to set themselves to private on June 12th over new pricing for third-party app developers to access the site’s APIs. Setting a subreddit to private, aka “going dark,” will mean that the communities taking part will be inaccessible by the wider public while the planned 48-hour protest is taking place.\nAs a Reddit post about the protest, that’s since been cross-posted to several participating subreddits, explains:\nOn June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren’t able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn’t something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\nA complete list of the hundreds of communities taking part (known in Reddit parlance as “subreddits”) includes dozens with over a million subscribers each.\nThe protest comes after the developers of several third-party Reddit apps have said the future of their services have been threatened by the company’s new pricing. The developer behind Apollo, for example, said that at its current rate of making 7 billion requests per month, it would need to pay $1.7 million for access to Reddit’s API, or $20 million a year. “I don’t see how this pricing is anything based in reality or remotely reasonable,” developer Christian Selig wrote. “I hope it goes without saying that I don’t have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card.”\nHowever, one of Reddit’s employees has argued that the new API charges should be affordable if third-party apps are efficient with the API calls they make. “Our pricing is $0.24 per 1000 API calls, which equates to <$1.00 per user monthly for a reasonably operated app,” they wrote. “Apollo as an app is less efficient than its peers and at times has been excessive — probably because it has been free to be so.”\nBut the developers behind other third-party Reddit apps have expressed similar concerns. Reddit is Fun said it would have to pay a figure “in the same ballpark” as Apollo to continue to operate and that it “does not earn anywhere remotely near this number.” The developer behind Narwhal said it will be “dead in 30 days” as a result of the charges.\nThe potential for third-party apps to cease operations is particularly problematic for subreddit moderators, who say they often rely on these tools to manage their communities. “In many cases these apps offer superior mod tools, customization, streamlined interfaces, and other quality of life improvements that the official app does not offer,” moderator BuckRowdy wrote in an open letter that’s since been co-signed by the moderators of numerous other subreddits. “The potential loss of these services due to the pricing change would significantly impact our ability to moderate efficiently.”\nAs well as the new API pricing, the open letter also raises concerns about the ability of third-party apps to show ads (a key source of revenue), and new restrictions that would prevent NSFW (not safe for work) content from being made available via the API.\nReddit has seen several protests like these throughout its history. In 2021, for example, hundreds of Reddit communities locked down to protest the site’s handling of a controversy around a former UK politician it had hired (Reddit later confirmed it had cut ties with the individual). Moderators took similar collective action the previous year in protest over Reddit’s hate speech policies.",

    "maintext": "Introduction\nOne of the main use cases of LangChain is connecting LLMs to user data, allowing users to build personalized LLM applications. A key part of this is retrieval - fetching relevant documents based on user queries.\nToday we’re happy to announce the integration of Vectara into LangChain to help make retrieval easier. In this blog post, we’ll dig deeper into why retrieval is so important and how to use Vectara’s LangChain integration to build scalable LLM-powered applications.\nWhat is Vectara?\nVectara is a GenAI conversational search platform, providing an easy-to-use “ChatGPT for your own data'' experience using “Grounded Generation”.\nDevelopers can use Vectara’s API, based on a neural search core, which enables highly accurate matching between queries and relevant documents, to build GenAI conversational search applications, such as our AskNews sample application.\nUsing Vectara simplifies LLM application development: the search platform does a lot of the heavy lifting of interfacing with user data, letting developers focus on the application logic unique to their product.\nFigure 1: Vectara’s API platform for “Grounded Generation”\nGrounded Generation with LangChain\nLLMs are extremely powerful models, but they have a problem with data recency and hallucinations. For example, as mentioned in this blog post about LLM hallucinations, if you ask ChatGPT about Silicon Valley Bank, it will provide a response based on the pre-2022 data it was trained on, and will have no idea above the bank’s recent collapse.\n“Grounded Generation” is a general approach to address this issue and is one of the main use cases available through LangChain.\nFigure 2: Grounded Generation. Content is first transformed into embeddings, and stored in a vector store. When a user issues a query, we first identify relevant facts by matching the query embedding with relevant pieces of content previously indexed and provide those facts to the summarization model (along with the query) to provide an accurate response based on all the relevant known facts.\nLet’s look at a simple example of question-answering with retrieval augmented generation from the LangChain codebase.\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langcain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS raw_docs = TextLoader(‘state_of_the_union.txt').load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_docs) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings) qa = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()) Figure 3: Default implementation of retrieval augmented generation with LangChain\nFirst, we take the document text (in this case, a transcript of the 2022 State of the Union) and use langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter to split the text into small chunks (1000 characters each).\nThen we get embeddings for each chunk using OpenAIEmbeddings, and store them in a vector database like FAISS.\nFinally, we build a RetrievalQA ( retrieval question-answer) chain.\nAnd the answer we get is.\n“Putin miscalculated that the world would roll over when he rolled into Ukraine.”\nPretty cool!\nLangChain question-answering with Vectara\nLet’s run the same program, but this time use Vectara as the vector store. Doing this will take advantage of Vectara’s “Grounded Generation”.\nFirst, we set up a Vectara account and create a corpus. After creating an API key for that corpus, we can set up the required arguments as environment variables:\nexport VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID= export VECTARA_CORPUS_ID= export VECTARA_API_KEY=<...API-KEY…>\nVectara provides its own embeddings that are optimized for accurate retrieval, so we actually don’t have to use (or pay for) an additional embedding model. Instead, we simply use Vectara.from_documents() to upload the documents into Vectara’s index for this corpus, and use that as a retriever in the chain:\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Vectara loader = TextLoader(“state_of_the_union.txt”) documents = loader.load() vectara = Vectara.from_documents(documents) qa = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=vectara.as_retriever()) print(qa({“query”: “According to the document, what did Vladimir Putin miscalculate?”})) Figure 3: Question answering with LangChain + Vectara. Architecture is much simpler and more robust as the storage of document embedding and matching queries to relevant facts is taken care of by the Vectara platform/API.\nVectara takes the source documents and automatically chunks it in an optimized manner and creates the embeddings, so we don’t even have to use the TextSplitter (and decide on chunk size), nor do we need to call (or pay for) OpenAIEmbeddings. Since Vectara has its own internal vector storage, we don’t need to use FAISS or any other commercial vector database.\nFinally, we build a RetrievalQA (retrieval question-answer) chain in the same way as before, and again we get the response:\n“Putin miscalculated that the world would roll over when he rolled into Ukraine.”\nSummary\nWe are excited to have Vectara fully integrated with LangChain, making it easier for developers who already love LangChain to build LLM-powered applications with Grounded Generation.\nBig thanks to the Vectara team (Ofer, Amr and many others) for their support and contribution.\nIf you’d like to experience the benefits of Vectara + LangChain firsthand, you can sign up for a free Vectara account here.",

    "maintext": "We always wondered how an NBA Finals would feel in Denver.\nWe are finding out. It’s emotional, intense and expensive!\nMy father loved basketball. Dad played at West, and then coached hoops at Denver’s post-World War II JCC. Sheldon Silverman bought a great, sturdy backboard for our southeast Denver driveway. Our court was long, flat enough and smooth.\nIt was perfect for practice, and games of one-on-one, or even two-on-two. My Mom, serving treats between games, made it extra-popular.\nThere’s a new Allstate Mayhem ad depicting the kind of brotherly brawls Bill and I waged daily. My Dad occasionally officiated and broke up skirmishes. When I finally grew taller than Bill, I could win and outrun him. Most of the time.\nBut then along came a neighbor I could not beat. Hyman Goldburg moved in across the street. Hyman was 13 months older than me, but two grade levels ahead at school, making him a grade behind my brother Bill at GW. Hyman was smart, funny and athletic. We became fast friends.\nThis New York whiz kid, sporting his naturally red Jewfro, and moves like Earl Monroe, kept kicking my butt on my own concrete. I couldn’t comprehend how Coach Vaughn cut Hyman in the 10th grade. Hyman could hoop! Future all-state guard, Joe Strain and Hyman might have been unstoppable.\nThe Denver Rockets debuted when I was a sixth-grader. Before games, they’d let autograph-seeking kids down to the floor. My pal Freddy Freis persuaded Lonnie Wright, who was stretching on the floor, to roll us an ABA basketball. We told Lonnie his legs looked like sequoias. He liked that.\nNext season, I got Rick Barry to autograph the back of my Hill Junior High bus card on its signature line. It was that magical year we acquired Spencer Haywood and realized basketball could be played at the highest level in Denver.\nHaywood told me about that special rookie MVP season, and how he was blindsided by the racist Ringsbys, Denver’s franchise owners. Haywood recounted his Game Seven playoff fight with Rick Barry, and how Lonnie Wright (also a Denver Bronco) ended that melee.\nHaywood is loving Denver hoops again. Our Nuggets have never been more popular. Keep the Joker happy and that “D” in Denver may stand for “dynasty.” Wasn’t that TV show, Dynasty, set here?\nGame Two announcer Mike Breen claimed Joker is a combination of Kevin McHale and Larry Bird. Breen omitted their Celtics’ teammate Bill Walton, the magnificent passing center.\nBefore he got hurt, Walton was dominant like Haywood, winning league MVP. Walton further led Portland to the NBA title. Walton’s Trailblazers immediately destroyed our Denver home court advantage on the way to that 1977 championship. My father took me to that heartbreaking, one-point Game One loss during my glorious years playing basketball at Colorado College.\nWhen Walton, who I met and interviewed in 2017, came back on my show this week, it was a classic big man mismatch. Walton swatted away my suggestion our Nuggets would breeze by the Miami Heat without breaking a sweat. The Big Redhead predicted the series would be tough. Guess who knows more about NBA basketball?\nRegardless, Walton, who was busy dominating at UCLA, never witnessed the greatest clutch shooting display ever seen at any Denver pro basketball game. It was the dawn of the 1970s, a game at the Denver Coliseum against arch-nemesis Oakland Oaks.\nIn the first quarter, two qualifying tickets were selected for participation in a shooting contest at halftime. The competition began with participants each shooting five free throws. The winner next attempted the ABA’s innovative three-point shot for a big gift certificate. If that shot was made, a half-court basket would receive a new Camaro for a year from Spedding Chevrolet.\nOne ticket selected that night was for the seat occupied by Bruce Paul, the Ringsby’s prominent attorney. Declining participation, Mr. Paul turned to his law partner, Roger Goldburg, who turned to his son Hyman, who strode on the floor at halftime.\nThe 15-year-old redhead with the wild four-inch hair made all five free throws. We watched as Hyman confidently swished the three-pointer and then nailed the half-court shot. When it went in, my neighbor raised his hands like Rocky Balboa. The Denver Coliseum went delirious.\nThe dealership refused to give the Camaro to Hyman because he lacked even a learners permit. Almost as fast as they’d arrived, the Goldburgs moved and we lost touch. For over 50 years.\nThe Daily Sun-Up podcast | More episodes\nGoldburg and I spoke at length last Saturday night. He lives in Phoenix now but still roots for Denver. He remains smart and funny. Hy made me laugh hard as he described the Larry Brown-like blue velvet bell bottoms he wore that night he hit those seven shots in a row.\nThe Denver Nuggets bring people together. Special things can happen at Denver pro basketball games. I wish my father, big brother Bill and Freddy were all here to enjoy this excitement.\nIf necessary,Game 7 of the NBA Finals will be in Denver. On Fathers Day. Let’s go Nuggets!",

Now felt like the right time to step down and start the next phase of his life, including traveling more, Lambrow said.\n“I've had an amazing career at M&T and have a lot of great memories and appreciation for the outstanding work of all my friends and colleagues in the bank,” he said.\nA search for a successor in Wilmington is still underway, according to M&T Bank, which expects to name that individual in the coming weeks.\nLambrow joined the former First National Bank of Maryland back in 1980, entering its management program out of college and becoming a branch manager. He worked his way through consumer banking, commercial lending and business banking roles leading up to the then-Allfirst Bank’s acquisition by M&T Bank in 2003, after which he led the Chesapeake region from Annapolis, Md.\nreached a deal to acquire the embattled Wilmington Trust, Lambrow recognized the major coup for his employer, gaining a bank with a strong market share and respected institutional and capital market services.

    "title_page": "Richard Hanania on the Tech Right - by Arnold Kling",
    "title_rss": "NULL",
    "maintext": "Richard Hanania writes,\nThe Tech Right combines the acceptance of inequality of the right with the openness to change of the left. The pro-change, anti-equality quadrant is the sweet spot for support for capitalism, so of course they tend to favor free market economic policies. This explains the enthusiasm in this world for Bitcoin, which represents the longstanding libertarian dream of society moving away from fiat currency.\nBack in 2000, Paulina Borsook came out with Cyberselfish, about the libertarian tech faction. Honestly, I think they looked more formidable then than they do now. And although I probably align more closely with the Tech Right than any other faction, I have not drunk the Bitcoin Kool-Aid.\nHanania, no doubt looking at Patrick Deneen and the NatCons (is that a good name for a rock group?), writes,\nIf you think the Enlightenment was a mistake because eventually we got transgenderism, you need some perspective.\nAnd while I’m highlighting fun sentences, there is\nAs soon as an open-minded individual starts thinking about crime and urban disorder, they find that misguided compassion and anti-racism are why the country can’t have nice things.\nAnd then this:\nUniversities have become a kind of halfway house for the most neurotic and conformist members of the educated class.\nGee, I wonder why. Hint: look up the literature on average gender differences in the Big Five trait of neuroticism.\nHanania has an interesting argument that academia selects for people who like conformity and paperwork, while tech selects for people with pure intellectual curiosity and a taste for innovation. I hope you know me well enough to grasp that I am on the latter end of the spectrum. As much as I like to acquire knowledge and to write, when I’m with a group of academics I feel like a fish out of water. I had that same feeling working at the Fed. At Freddie Mac, I took on the role of intrapreneur. When I started one of the first Web businesses, I was in my element. And if I were younger and more focused, I would be trying to turn one of my LLM app ideas into a business right now.\nI like to talk about an un-conference I attended in SF about six years ago. There was an economist Nobel Laureate participating, and had this been an academic event he would have been surrounded by people eager to hang on his every word. But he did not get much attention, and it turned out that tech luminaries like Patrick Collison and Eric Weinstein were more interested in talking with Noah Smith or me. I found that highly flattering.\nAnyway, back to Hanania.\nThe Tech Right is in many ways anti-populist, and will hopefully stand in the way of those trying to make Republicans more friendly to labor unions, entitlement spending, and economic regulation. There’s been something of a marriage of convenience between populists and the Tech Right based on the fact that both are anti-woke, but in the end decisions about how to govern have to be made. …My belief is that whatever economic populism currently exists on the right is only skin deep, something that is most aggressively championed when it can make Biden look bad, while free market ideals, particularly when it comes to not raising taxes, still have a stronger hold on the minds of educated conservatives. … Heading off economic populism now and not letting conservatives become too attached to protecting entitlements needs to be a top priority.\nHere, Hanania sounds to me like a Paul Ryan Republican. As it stands today, that faction is under the bus, having been tossed there by Donald Trump and his supporters. If Hanania is counting on the Tech Right to reverse that under-bussing, I have to say that is wishful thinking.\nShare\nSubstacks referenced above:\n@",

    "maintext": "Getting digitally cloned was easier than Devin Finley expected it to be. The voice-over artist, who also works as a model and bar manager, entered a studio in Manhattan last spring and read a script from a teleprompter.\nAcross the room, a man with a large camera working for Hour One, a Tel Aviv–based video agency specializing in providing clients with lifelike virtual humans, filmed Finley from the waist up. Over Zoom, a director offered instructions about how much to move his hands. He was done in less than an hour.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Finley first learned that he could license his virtual twin, he had reservations. He was skeptical that a digital double, as the nascent sub-industry calls it, could capture his personality. He also disapproved of A.I.–generated avatars eventually taking jobs from people. Then again, the situation enabled the impossible. “You can be in two places at one time,” he said, and the new income stream meant that “as you get older or you’re on vacation, your avatar is still virtually making money for you,” possibly speaking a language he has never learned, without ever aging beyond 36.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAnd so Finley accepted an initial payment of $500 and signed a contract giving Hour One a certain number of credits to book his twin in videos used for marketing, product tutorials, online training, employee onboarding, and more. If he was in high demand, Hour One, which lists Nvidia, Microsoft, and DreamWorks among its clients, would buy more credits from him.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s a new technology—either you hate it or you love it,” Finley said. So long as the company kept its promise to keep him out of political, sexual, and malicious content, he was open to loving it.\nNot so long ago, concerns about digital doubles seemed like fantastical sci-fi matters. But at the moment, it’s looking increasingly plausible that disagreements over how to handle them could contribute to one of the largest Hollywood labor strikes in decades. A couple of weeks ago, leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the primary union representing actors and other performers, asked its 160,000 members to vote by June 5 on whether they are authorized to strike if studios and streaming companies waver on their contract demands. Among other nonnegotiables, the union is determined to make it clear how much performers should get paid and when they must be consulted for studios to use A.I.–generated simulations of their voice or likeness. The Writers Guild of America is already on strike (and citing its own A.I.–replacement fears). If the actors join the writers, it would be the first time in more than 60 years that the two unions have simultaneously halted work.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, the moment when anyone can easily make a convincing video featuring any celebrity or public figure is rapidly approaching. Within “the coming weeks,” the buzzy startup Runway is going to release a tool that turns text and image prompts into videos, a spokeswoman told me. Promotional materials imply that Runway makes it possible to take a photo of anyone and turn them into a semi-realistic 3D character. Google has invested $75 million in the endeavor, the Information reported last week. Every day, it seems, ever-improving deepfakes have been wreaking new forms of havoc and spawning novel attempts to capitalize on the technology. Among other notable moments of the past few weeks: a deepfake of former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tricked activist Bill Browder into a video call.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nHere are more details on the deep fake video call supposedly with former Ukrianing president Petro Poroshenko I was tricked into participating yesterday https://t.co/pLJB1vG3Sc https://t.co/rf2Kbw0UPA — Bill Browder (@Billbrowder) May 25, 2023\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSo are we on the cusp of major studios forcing Meryl Streep into a sequel by casting her digital double? Not quite. It’s not that studios wouldn’t want to. But, unions aside, A.I. can’t replicate top-notch acting from scratch. Just yet.\nAdvertisement\nAmid the frequently confusing discussion about A.I. replacing actors, here’s a look at some concrete ways that A.I. doppelgangers are already being used (on union and non-union productions alike). What becomes clear is that the future that actors are warning about is already here. You just might have missed it.\nConcrete Use No. 1: Creating Remarkably Unremarkable Ads With Athletes Too Busy to Get to Set\nFace swapping your way into an ad is on its way to becoming the Zooming into a meeting of the celebrity ad hustle—or so I concluded after talking to Alexandra Shangin, a co-founder of Brask Doubles, an A.I. content agency. The big names that brands want are often busy. But there is no need for French soccer star Kylian Mbappé or Argentinian soccer phenomenon Lionel Messi—two athletes who have worked with Brask—to show up on the set.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThough this appears to be Mbappé sprinting across a stadium at the 15-second mark in this ad for Mengniu, a Chinese dairy company, it’s not:\nAdvertisement\nRather, the runner is a human double, who shares Mbappé’s build and skin tone, wearing what Shangin calls an “A.I.–generated digital mask.” Brask, which has offices in Delaware, Dubai, and beyond, trained its A.I. tool on videos and photos of Mbappé, studying how the French forward’s face looks at various angles and in different lighting scenarios, and then superimposed it onto the double.\nLong before easy-to-use generative A.I. models entered the equation, the public was exposed to a vast array of impressive and disturbing digital doubles. A hologram of Tupac, who died in 1996, performed at Coachella in 2012. A resurrected Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, appeared in the 2016 Star Wars movie Rogue One. In 2018 the New York Times detailed some of the terrifying ways that that deepfake technology was being used online, including placing a woman who looks like Michelle Obama in a porn video. Other similarly off-putting usages prompted think tanks and op-ed writers to warn that deepfakes were on the cusp of sparking a war or manipulating an election.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFast-forward five years. Generative A.I. has gotten exponentially better. And what we get is a doctored but benign clip of a soccer star that looks nearly identical to thousands of other clips of that same star? Yes, indeed. Perhaps the true sign of A.I. takeover is that the technology has evolved from novelty to production hack. Brands may pay a comparable amount to the star as if they showed up in person. But by removing the celebrity and his team from that shoot, scheduling conflicts and travel costs disappear. None of this made sense back when hyperrealistic 3D face swapping required a labor-intensive animation process. But now weeks of work take days. The cost-to-hassle calculus is increasingly pointing to digital doubles.\nAdvertisement\nAnd unless the star does something totally out of character, no one will suspect that it’s A.I. Speaking Russian was the giveaway when Brask’s sister company Deepcake (yes, that’s its name) placed “Bruce Willis” in an ad for MegaFon, a Russian mobile phone company, two years ago. The ad generated incorrect reports that Willis had sold his digital life rights. Shangin told me her company focuses on hiring celebrities for specific projects. “We just provide the service so the talent can make more of their personality.”\nConcrete Use No. 2: Building Synthespians on Top of Body Doubles\nHow long will it be before A.I. actors are competing for awards? If the technology can wow us with its ability to create realistic photos of popes in puffer jackets and convincingly conjure up a Drake and the Weeknd collaboration, surely we’ll eventually get an A.I.–generated actor worthy of an Oscar, right?\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWrong, say some of the people most knowledgeable about on-screen A.I. Matt Panousis, the chief operating officer of the company Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (or MARZ), spent an hour telling me about the many ways that A.I. is a visual-effects “paradigm changer” enabling artists to dramatically speed up their work. But when we got to casting A.I., his tone changed. “The idea that in the near future we’re going to have entirely A.I. actors that will be able to perform and look perfectly real and they will negate the need for real actors—I think it’s a little pie-in-the-sky.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOthers gave it two years. But for now, A.I. can only generate face makeup of a sort, which goes over a body double, who does the acting. The double’s voice may later get altered to sound like the star. But producers are still reliant on these human stand-ins for intonation and facial expressions. This is the case whether you want to revive a dead actor or place twin siblings in a single shot. As with the TV ads, the body doubles will ideally share a hairline and face shape with the actual actor, as you can see in this clip from MARZ:\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvances in this tech have already begun boosting demand for body doubles who can act. Does this eliminate concerns about how studios will use A.I. to exploit actors? Of course not. Just because you can’t yet program a wryly funny Jason Bateman look-alike doesn’t mean you can’t create an eighth season of the 1980s sitcom Family Ties by placing his sister’s face on a body double. That’s what she says, anyway.\nAdvertisement\n“No film is locked,” director and producer Justine Bateman, who studied computer science and rose to fame as Mallory Keaton on Family Ties, told me. I reached out after reading her widely shared Twitter thread predicting the ways A.I. would ruin Hollywood. She’s particularly concerned about producers placing actors’ likenesses in scenes they never shot.\nEven if SAG-AFTRA gets its way, this is bound to happen, but it will require more pleading and money. “We want to see consent, fair compensation, and appropriate limits on any use of digitally created performances,” a union representative told me. Now they get to hash it out at the bargaining table.\nConcrete Use No. 3: Creating Dubbing That No Longer Looks Like Dubbing\nEven the most gifted actor can act in only one language at a time; a dubbed film’s mismatch between lips and words is just something audiences have to deal with. Or it was. Last week, MARZ released a video showing off its new lip-dubbing feature. In the video, actor Adam Brody speaks what appears to be fluent French in the movie The Kid Detective. “We just need the audio for the original footage and we run it through the lip dub,” Panousis told me.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSeveral other production companies have recently released—or are on the cusp of unveiling—similar tools. A downside of this is that it will be easier to pull a Kendall Roy. In this season’s Succession, the power-hungry son asks an editor to modify a video of his deceased father to misrepresent a new business endeavor. A desire to misuse these technologies is far from hypothetical. Shangin said Brask has had to turn down requests to create videos of an actual politician doing drugs and other people saying compromising things.\nConcrete Use No. 4: Putting (Possibly Awkward) Talking Heads in Instructional Videos\nAdvertisement\nIs allowing a company to place a moving, speaking avatar of you in an A.I.–facilitated real estate ad all that different from appearing in traditional ads? As we talked on the phone, it became clear that Finley was still working through the answer to this question. What he seemed certain of is that it’s better than signing up for a stock photo shoot, something he did during the pandemic, while work was slow. That particular gig paid even less than the digital-double gig, promised zero residuals, and similarly forced him to relinquish control of how his likeness is used.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThis job was faster and easier. “I don’t feel like I was used or abused,” Finley told me, when it became clear that I was horrified that he was only paid $500 to clone himself. Still, he’d like to see some sort of universal guidelines emerge eventually—beyond just the unions. (Finley is one of many performers who are not eligible to be in SAG-AFTRA.)\nFor now, the career of Finley’s digital double is advancing slowly. One of his main gigs has been playing a futuristic cop in Burner Face, a sci-fi audio movie. The only video he has appeared in so far is a sort of promotional video for that project. In the video, his lips don’t entirely sync with his words. And because Hour One trained its system only on his likeness—not his deep, dramatic voice—we hear someone else’s A.I.-generated words.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSooner or later, other offers should come. Berlitz, the language learning company, hired eight “virtual instructors” to pump out 20,000 videos, Natalie Monbiot, Hour One’s head of strategy, told me. The site also lists numerous major companies as clients, though it’s not clear if they hired 1 of the 150 or so “virtual talents” Hour One offers or cloned their own employees, another suggested use. “It can help you scale your presence and look polished every time,” said Monbiot. Synthesia, a similar A.I. video company, told me it’s now working with “more than 15,000 corporate clients, including 35% of the Fortune 100.”\nAdvertisement\nRelated from Slate Bruce Schneier and Jim Waldo The Leak That Has Big Tech and Regulators Panicked Read More\nIan Beacraft, a trend consultant and self-identified “gonzo futurist,” was similarly positive about joining Hour One’s talent pool. Beacraft’s digital double now hosts The Future Report, a tech news segment on DeFiance Media, which covers “decentralized culture, finance, and technology.” That company also uses an A.I. rendition of another actor’s voice. Beacraft still writes the scripts, but “I don’t have to get stage makeup or do the lights,” he said. Ultimately, he believes that in the not-so-distant future, after people become popular online, they will, rather than get offered a book deal, be asked to license their digital twins. “The real danger is when you have a marketplace where I can just take anyone and make a random person and get close to them” without actually being them, he told me. Then companies can avoid paying humans altogether, since their creations will cease to qualify as doubles.\nAdvertisement\nThat’s a possible future, but it’s not quite here yet. So where does this leave actors now? I found myself thinking about the first time I learned that a friend took compensation f﻿rom a brand for an Instagram post. How fake of her, I thought. By the time she leveraged a similar deal to get a flight to Iceland, I was impressed. It’s tempting to think that, like so many seismic changes before, we’ll just get used to this coming phase of the talent economy.\nBut digital cloning requires ceding control in a different kind of way. Regardless of whether you license your avatar or someone else surreptitiously creates it, once it exists you’re no longer in charge of what you say, where you go, or how you move. The battle for that control will affect almost every aspect of the A.I.-twin era we’re now entering, no matter how specific anyone’s contracts get.",

    "maintext": "× Expand Joe Mabel/Wikimedia Commons The Glacier Northwest cement works in Kenmore, Washington\nOn the face of it, last Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling returning a lawsuit to a state court looks bad for unions. Eight of the Court’s nine justices ruled in Glacier Northwest v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local Union 174 that the union of the cement-mixer drivers based in Tukwila, Washington, could be sued by their employer for damages inflicted on the employer’s property; in this case, concrete that had dried and hardened before it could be poured. The Washington State Supreme Court had tossed the employer’s suit, saying that state laws in such matters were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, and that jurisdiction belonged to the NLRB. Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion said that that court had erred, and the lawsuit could continue.\nMany in the labor movement had feared that the Court’s ruling in this case would significantly impinge on unions’ right to strike. It didn’t quite work out that way, as it focused so narrowly, and unusually, on the particulars of the case (and may well have gotten those particulars wrong) rather than any underlying laws.\nMore from Harold Meyerson\nBarrett’s opinion doesn’t dispute that strikes generally inflict economic damage on employers—at least, a loss of revenue. That’s entirely permitted by the NLRA, Barrett noted. The ruling also cited the Court’s 1959 decision in San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, which stated that when the activity in question “is arguably subject” to the NLRA, “the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board.” Indeed, Garmon was the basis of the Washington court’s refusal to try the case.\nNevertheless, Barrett ruled that the union’s conduct was so deliberately destructive of property that it wasn’t even “arguably subject” to the NLRB’s jurisdiction.\nAnd yet, consider the following sentence about the Teamsters, which begins her statement of the “facts” in the case:\n“Their labor union allegedly designed the strike with the intent to sabotage Glacier’s property.”\nAllegedly?\nOn the 2017 day that cement-mixer drivers for the Glacier Northwest company went on strike, the drivers struck while a number of them were already on their routes, which Barrett also acknowledges is NLRA-protected conduct. (Indeed, strikes generally begin when workers are at work; you can’t walk off the job when you and your fellow workers are at home asleep at 2 a.m.) The workers drove their mixers back to the company’s yard and kept the mixers turning, which keeps the concrete from hardening.\nHowever, Barrett notes, “the Union did not take the simple step of alerting Glacier that these trucks had been returned.”\nThis somehow presumes that company managers wouldn’t have noticed that a number of trucks had suddenly reappeared in the yards, hours before they were scheduled to. That aside, in its suit, Glacier Northwest alleged that hardening concrete risked damaging the trucks themselves, though it also admitted that no trucks had in fact been damaged. It continued that its supervisors had to pour out the concrete in a safe location, though some of it, once poured, then hardened and ceased to be usable.\nThe Court doesn’t usually deliver rulings that assess the factual details of a case, confining itself almost always to the issues of constitutional law.\nFor its part, the Teamsters argued that it told drivers to return the trucks to the yard and to keep their mixers turning, thereby not intentionally damaging Glacier Northwest’s property, which is conduct the NLRA expressly forbids. Union lawyers further argued that previous Court rulings had made clear that the spoiling of perishable goods could not be the subject of lawsuits, and that jurisdiction in such cases belonged to the NLRB. (They cited one decision about strikers who handled raw poultry, another about striking milk truck drivers, and a third about striking cheese processors.)\nLet’s stop for a moment and consider where the Court is headed on this. As a guide, here’s an assessment from Catherine Fisk, the Barbara Nachtrieb Armstrong Professor of Law at UC Berkeley, and one of the nation’s leading labor law scholars, who wondered aloud to the Prospect, “Is this a special rule for cement trucks? Distinguishing between poultry, milk, and cheese spoilage on one side and cement on the other?”\nBarrett asserted in the ruling that “by reporting for duty and pretending as if they would deliver the concrete, the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product.” But how is that different from the milk truck drivers of yore striking while en route, or the poultry workers separating the legs from the thighs and only then walking off the job, leaving the wings still affixed to the breasts? To be sure, concrete weighs more than chickens and cheese, but if that’s the basis of a Supreme Court ruling, the Court could at least do us the courtesy of stipulating the exact poundage at which the NLRB’s Garmon jurisdiction grinds to a halt.\nAs Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted in her dissent, the Court doesn’t usually deliver rulings that assess the factual details of a case, confining itself almost always to the issues of constitutional law. And yet, Barrett’s opinion reads almost entirely like that of a county court trial judge, weighing management’s claims against the workers’. And even then, it begins with the word “allegedly”—accepting, as it does, the company’s statement of the facts, hedged only by that adverb. One lawyer to whom I spoke said that in asking the Court to dismiss this case outright, the union’s lawyers inadvertently enabled the Court to accept as fact the submission from the company. In light of the extensive documentation those lawyers have also produced of the union instructing its drivers to return the trucks and keep them mixing, however, several other attorneys have told me that the original trial court could well reject the company’s claims, as could the NLRB, which has yet to rule on the case.\nAll that said, why on earth did Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor join with the Court’s six conservatives in signing on to Barrett’s opinion? Kagan and Sotomayor, after all, have a long history of supporting workers’ collective and individual rights, and are, if anything, staunch guardians of the rights enshrined in the NLRA.\nFor that, we need to consult the concurring opinion from Clarence Thomas, which Neil Gorsuch signed onto as well. In it, Thomas suggested that the Court should go much further than it did in this case and get into the more fundamental question of whether the NLRA’s right to preempt state courts as laid down in Garmon shouldn’t be subject to the Court’s revision or revocation. “We should carefully reexamine whether the law supports Garmon’s unusual pre-emption regime,” Thomas wrote, while noting that Barrett’s governing opinion didn’t even touch upon that larger topic.\nIn light of the Thomas-Gorsuch opinion, there’s been considerable speculation that Kagan and Sotomayor went along with Barrett in a de facto deal to fend off the possibility of a ruling that did indeed strike down Garmon and thereby give (largely right-wing) judges in (largely right-wing) states the go-ahead to start issuing rulings that fined unions for the financial damages that employers incurred in the course of a strike. And even if that opinion didn’t go that far, it could have done more overtly, with support of all six conservative justices, what Thomas and Gorsuch came close to doing in their concurrence: inviting the enemies of unions to file a case that directly challenged Garmon.\nThat was precisely the decision that unions had feared might come out of the Glacier Northwest v. Teamsters case, which explains the relief with which many unions greeted last Thursday’s ruling. “It’s not good,” AFL-CIO Senior Counsel Craig Becker told the Prospect, “but it’s not that bad compared to what it could have been.”\nCoincidentally, these were almost the exact words spoken by Democratic members of the House and Senate about the debt ceiling deal they sent to the president, also on Thursday.\nThus ended the “not that bad compared to what it could have been” week in the nation’s capital.",

    "maintext": "This study points out the structure of the rostral epidural rete mirabile and its function in the long-necked giraffe. Furthermore, this study is part of a more significant study that aims to describe the combined features that allow giraffes to successfully circulate blood to the brain, avoid fainting, escape brain damage and prevent oedema in the legs.\nPragmatically, we can assume giraffes () experience several physiological challenges due to their extraordinary build. Detailed tests on captive giraffes showed that these animals have a very high blood pressure of approximately 200–400 mmHg [ 1 3 ]. At this pressure, certain key physiological issues arise. For instance, the heart must pump blood to the brain against gravitational pressure and would encounter vascular friction towards the brain, situated approximately 2 m above the heart. Some studies have investigated possible adaptations to the physiological challenges of giraffes [ 2 5 ]. Few studies describe the unified function of how giraffes successfully circulate blood, avoid fainting and blackouts, escape brain damage and prevent oedema in the legs. A unique anatomical structural differentiation called the rostral epidural rete mirabile [ 4 9 ] is present in Cetartiodactyla, including giraffe. The rostral epidural rete mirabile is absent in Perissodactyls, but cats and dogs also have a rostral epidural rete mirabile [ 10 15 ]. The rostral epidural rete mirabile is described as a complex network of arteries and veins situated at the base of the cranium [ 8 17 ]. The entire rete in Artiodactyls is situated intracranially, within the cavernous venous sinus, which is different from other species, such as cats and certain primates that also have a rostral epidural rete mirabile [ 8 18 ]. Alteration of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery developing into the rostral epidural rete mirabile network structure occurs in the embryo. In Artiodactyls, the common carotid artery transitions into the maxillary artery, from where it enters the skull through the carotid foramen and transitions into the network of the rostral epidural rete mirabile. The brain blood supply is thus different from the supply via the internal carotid and basilar artery, as in other species [ 6 8 ], to the maxillary artery connecting to the carotid arterial network in giraffes. The rostral cerebral artery and the caudal communicating artery are responsible for the main supply to the cerebral arterial circle. In giraffes, the basilar artery is undeveloped and therefore does not form part of the pathways through which blood can be supplied to the brain [ 7 19 ]. The basilar artery in sperm whales () is similarly non-functional concerning the blood supply to the brain [ 12 ]. The basilar artery is prominent in dromedary camels () and other ruminants and services the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum [ 20 ]. The maxillary artery is dominant in its blood supply to the circle of Willis. Still, the basilar artery in these species is directly connected to the circle of Willis, with the course of flow directed caudally and not rostral [ 21 ]. Extending from the retial meshwork, the intracranial maxillary artery branch configures into the brain’s arterial circle, also known as the circle of Willis [ 6 19 ]. The intracranial maxillary artery segment emerging from the rete forms a split with the caudal intracranial carotid artery [ 15 ]. The arterial circle of the brain receives blood predominantly from the maxillary artery with a non-functional basilar artery that cannot be utilized to supply any substantial amount of blood to the cranium in giraffes [ 8 22 ]. The study of [ 7 ] on Old and New World camelids showed that the cerebral arterial blood supply originates directly from the rostral epidural rete mirabile and the basilar artery. Additionally, in contrast to an artiodactyl’s, the rostral epidural rete mirabile of camelids anastomose with branches of both the maxillary and internal carotid artery. [ 18 ] have suggested three functions of the rostral epidural rete mirabile: the regulation of blood flow and pressure to encephalic circulation, temperature regulation and the movement of pheromones from venous blood originating from the nasal mucosa to the hypophysis. [ 23 ] focused on the rostral epidural rete mirabile functioning to regulate blood flow in the average bodily environment. [ 10 24 ] described the rete to allow adequate brain perfusion in instances of break-in blood flowing towards the brain as a direct result of the various anastomoses between the two sides of the rete. The rete thus acts as a protective measure preventing high perfusion pressure with the facilitation of increased blood flow during unusual conditions. Furthermore, the rostral epidural rete mirabile allows for adequate blood flow necessary for brain function concurrently with reducing high systolic blood pressure, influencing mean perfusion pressure minimally [ 24 ], and the lack of valves within the cranial cavity support venous blood resuming from the brain. The morphology and structural function of the rostral epidural rete mirabile may vary in different species, with a distinction in the main blood suppliers to this meshwork [ 25 ].\nFlow per minute was calculated by averaging the five measurements for each rostral epidural rete mirabile length. The pressure was calculated by using the same experimental setup. A pressure meter (Yoto PG802C-3-10KPA,2017101312,0-10KPA,0.25%FS) was inserted after the rostral epidural rete mirabile to measure pressure. The pressure difference was calculated using the pressure measured before the flow entered the rostral epidural rete mirabile network and after the flow through the rete mirabile network. The pressure measured post flow through the rostral epidural rete mirabile was subtracted from the pressure measured prior to entering the rete. The pressure before 4750 mmHO measured height gives the water column in meters, from where the pressure was calculated and expressed in mmHg. The five pressure measurements were again averaged for each rostral epidural rete mirabile length ( Figure 2 B).\nWe mimicked a basic rete network to determine what influence the number of turns or spirals in the rostral epidural rete mirabile structure might have on flow tempo. The serial setup of the experimental flow test, even though a limitation to the actual anatomy of the carotid rete, is utilized to represent the influence of the rete structure. A rostral epidural rete mirabile network was mimicked using 4-mm diameter plastic fish tank air pump tubing. The tubing was measured into 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m and 6-m lengths and then winded around a standard 25-mm diameter plastic pipe to imitate the rostral epidural rete mirabile ( Figure 1 a,b). Plastic fish piping was fixed against a wall, giving a length of 4750 mm. Water, at room temperature, was used. Connections were constructed in a manner so that water could be opened with a switch and for the water to be pumped through the rostral epidural rete mirabile and upwards to the height of 4750 mm. The water flow was opened for one minute. The amount of water that ran through the system was measured. The change in water level before and after the rete mirabile was measured after the minute ( Figure 2 A). The experiment was repeated five times for each of the different lengths that simulated the carotid rete.\nThe samples were then placed in a 10% buffered formalin (10% aqueous solution and 4% formaldehyde). The formalin-fixed tissue was processed overnight in a VIP6 tissue processor and was embedded manually in wax blocks. Following embedding, 2–4 µm thick sections were cut, placed on glass slides, and stained with haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s Trichrome (for muscle and collagen fibers) and Verhoeff–Van Gieson (for elastic fibers) using standard methods. The stained slides were then covered, slipped and evaluated. Pictures were taken from the section pre-carotid rete, post-carotid rete and sections within the rostral epidural rete mirabile at a 2.5× magnification with a Leica DM750 microscope with a Leica ICC50 W camera. The Tunica media of the arteries were measured using the microscope.\nOne giraffe head was used for dissection to obtain histological samples of the carotid rete, the artery at the origin of the carotid rete and the artery at the exit of the carotid rete. The head was divided into two symmetrical halves, cut along the midline from the middle point between the two ossicones through the skull and neck vertebra with a Makita Recipro saw. The rostral epidural rete mirabile was located above the brain plate in the cranium and then photographed with a Canon 7D camera and a 24–105 mm lens. A sample of the rostral epidural rete mirabile was taken, as well as a sample at the origin before branching into the rostral epidural rete mirabile network. A sample was also taken at the exit of the rostral epidural rete mirabile network.\nTwo giraffe heads were used to determine brain volume. Most of the skin and meat were removed from the skulls. The skulls were then buried and left to decay naturally, allowing a completely clean skull. The two halves of each head were filled with latex molding rubber (A. Shak (Pty) Ltd., SA) and allowed to set. Each latex cast was removed and paired with the correct other halves. Brain volume was determined by submerging the endocast in a measurement jug filled with water and measuring the amount of water displaced.\nFour giraffe heads were used for latex infusion. The latex mixture combinations used for the arterial and venous systems varied. The basic ingredients included: Barium sulphate (BaSO 4 ) (X-ray grade, Kyron Powder, Kyron, SA, and Latex moulding rubber (A. Shak (Pty) Ltd., Durban, South Africa). Additionally, to distinguish and differentiate the arteries from the veins, a red (Stamp ink, Office Mate, South Africa) pigment was used to infuse arteries, and a blue pigment (Print ink, Treeline, SA) was used in combination to infuse the veins. Arteries were infused with BaSO 4 powder at a forty percent volume, sixty percent latex volume and two percent volume red ink. Veins were infused with BaSO 4 powder of a twenty percent volume, eighty percent latex volume and two percent volume of blue ink. The vascular system was thoroughly rinsed with lukewarm water and subsequently filled with the different latex mixtures. A tube (10-mm PVW piping) was positioned 2 m above the vascular system to be able to use gravitation force to aid adequate latex infusion. Sutures (Catgut 3 Kyron, South Africa) and strings were utilized to keep the tubing in place. The common carotid artery was infused with the red combination latex, and the jugular vein with the blue combination latex. The infused arteries and veins were closed with catgut (Catgut 3 Kyron, SA). To encourage latex to set, the specimens were positioned at a 30° angle for 24 h. After the latex had been set, the specimens were separated at the midpoint between the ossicones with a Recipro saw (Makita). Care was taken to divide the specimens into identical halves through the skull and neck vertebra. Dissection originated at the C3 cervical vertebra trailing the arteries and veins up to the rete mirabile and the brain. BaSO 4 was included in the latex mixture for future radiographic imaging, as part of a dissertation.\nSamples were attained from animals culled by several nature reserves in South Africa and thus on an ad hoc basis. Unfortunately, the giraffe is culled by these reserves due to overstocking concentrations and diet shortages. The study samples were opportunistically gathered when these culling operations were conducted. The researchers were not involved in organizing or carrying out the culling procedure. As part of sustainable habitat use, most game ranches manage the number of animals conferring to the farm’s carrying capacity (available diet) that gets evaluated yearly. This annual management procedure includes live trade, translocations or culling the excess animals. This process is a well-thought-out recurrent management method used in the Southern Africa Wildlife Industry to maintain herbivore numbers applicable to the carrying capacity of the farm or reserve and to evade death due to starvation [ 26 ].\nThe speed at which the giraffe moves its head from ground level to fully erect is currently unknown and, unfortunately, not documented anywhere. Therefore, we can only speculate on the additional effect of the centripetal force on the cerebral blood supply in the giraffe.\nCentripetal force is the force a rotating object experiences. The path of the centripetal force is in the direction of the pivot point or inward-directed to the middle of the circle. The giraffe moves its head from ground level to fully direct it in a circular path ( Figure 9 ), similar to an object moving in a circle from the bottom to the top of the circle. The head experiences a centripetal force directed caudally along the atlanto-occipital joint. Blood that moves towards the head as it is moved to ground level experiences a centripetal force away from the head. The blood is forced to remain towards the head area, instead of flowing back towards that heart as expected due to gravity.\nIn the rete, the resistance does not change due to a decrease in vessel wall diameter, as shown in Table 1 . An example of a pressure drop due to a decrease in vessel wall diameter is in the tibialis artery, where the pressure drops due to the reduction in flow. We calculated the area of a 10-mm vessel ( Table 7 ) by the following equation:where:\nThe implication is that the structure of the rete only functions when blood flows. The pressure before, within, and after the rete is equal if there is no flow. Pressure decrease occurs due to (a) a decrease in the diameter of the vessel it flows through and (b) resistance against the inside area of the vessel it flows through. The resistance depends on the (a) change in vessel wall diameter and (c) the change in momentum of laminar flow.\nFrom Table 1 , it is evident that the Tunica media of the maxillary artery before it enters the rostral epidural rete mirabile and the tunica media of the intracranial maxillary artery at the exit of the rostral epidural rete mirabile are approximately three times thicker in comparison to the T. media of the rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries. We expected that the pre-carotid vessel’s tunica media would be larger than the T. media of the rete for more regulation pre-rete.\nIn Figure 5 , an illustration of the section of the pre-carotid rete, within the carotid rete, and post-rostral epidural rete mirabile is shown. Pictures were taken from the Verhoeff–Van Gieson-stained sections at a 2.5× magnification with a Leica DM750 microscope with a Leica ICC50 W camera. Measurements with the Leica DM750 microscope of the Tunica media of each of the sections are shown in Table 1\nIn this study, we found that for giraffes, the males have 69 mL of blood, and the females have 43 mL of blood present at any moment in the brain. This is notably a small volume compared to humans and other mammals. However, blood flow is relatively high, with 540 mL of blood per minute in the brain of a male giraffe and 420 mL of blood per minute in the brain of a female giraffe. If the brain’s blood percentage is calculated in male (0.089%) and female (0.077%) giraffes, it equates to less than 0.01% of the total blood volume. Giraffes thus need an average of 24.46 times less blood in the brain, as a proportion of the total supply, compared to humans. Therefore, only a small amount of blood, 0.01%, must be present in the giraffe’s brain at a specific time. Consequently, the physiological stress of large amounts of blood that need to be moved over the long head-to-heart distance to supply to the brain in the giraffe is reduced.\nThe brain endocasts revealed that the male giraffe’s volume was 900 mL and the female giraffe’s 700 mL. In most mammals, the total volume of blood is 5.5–8% of body mass [ 28 ]. For our calculations, we will use an average of 6.75%. In humans, the total blood volume in the body is 5.7 L of body mass in males and 4.3 L in females on average [ 29 ]. The human brain weighs about 1500 g with 100–130 mL of blood present at any moment in the brain [ 30 ]. We used the average of 115 mL of blood at a specific time in a 1500-g brain for our calculations. Blood flow through the brain is thus 60 mL of blood/100 g/min, with a total of 900 mL of blood per minute in the brain of humans. In humans, blood needed in the brain equates to 2.02% of the total blood volume.\nUpon dissection of the latex-filled arteries, the arterial pathway was followed from the C3 cervical vertebra to where the maxillary arteries enter the brain via the carotid foramina. The internal carotid artery forms the rostral epidural rete mirabile, the external carotid artery transitions into the maxillary artery. The pathway of the common carotid artery, with its transition to the external carotid artery and transition to the maxillary artery, is observed as a relatively straight pathway without bends. An interesting sharp bend is present before the entrance of the maxillary artery into the rostral epidural rete mirabile network ( Figure 3 a). Even though the latex injection did not perfuse much of the rostral epidural rete mirabile network, the network could clearly be identified, irrespective of size limitation, as visible in Figure 3 b. Having access to the complete giraffe, we observed that the heart is situated anteriorly in the chest compared to the heart of other ruminants, such as elephants and sable antelope ( Figure 4 ). The pathway of the blood from the heart to the brain is straight to allow for the easy and quick transport of blood without the resistance exerted by a curve or bend in the pathway.\n4. Discussion\nOur study on the blood supply from the heart to the brain in the physiologically challenged giraffe ( G. camelopardalis ) reveals the unique functional significance of the rostral epidural rete mirabile.\nC. dromedarius) measured 305 ± 9.7 cm, indicating the importance of the length and increased surface area for influencing the regulation of blood flow and, subsequently, blood pressure. Unfortunately, the latex mixture in our study did not fill the rete structure. Due to its extremely fine and interconnected network structure, we could not dissect the rostral epidural rete mirabile and measure its length. However, observing the rete structure closely revealed the network of numerous bends, suggesting a definite influence on blood flow through resistance exerted by bends in arterial walls [ Bos grunniens ), the rostral epidural rete mirabile was found to be highly developed compared to the rostral epidural rete mirabile in Chinese cattle ( Bos taurus ). In the Yak, the rete enables more efficient blood exchange and fulfills the critical function of a blood reservoir for blood supply to the brain [ Ref. [ 31 ] showed that the rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries in dromedary camels (measured 305 ± 9.7 cm, indicating the importance of the length and increased surface area for influencing the regulation of blood flow and, subsequently, blood pressure. Unfortunately, the latex mixture in our study did not fill the rete structure. Due to its extremely fine and interconnected network structure, we could not dissect the rostral epidural rete mirabile and measure its length. However, observing the rete structure closely revealed the network of numerous bends, suggesting a definite influence on blood flow through resistance exerted by bends in arterial walls [ 32 33 ]. The interconnected meshwork of arteries adds an overall significant enlargement of the cross-sectional area in vessels, resulting in reduced resistance as conferred using Poiseuille’s Law [ 9 32 ]. The structure will subsequently also reduce pressure [ 34 ]. In a study on the cerebral arterial blood flow in the Yak (), the rostral epidural rete mirabile was found to be highly developed compared to the rostral epidural rete mirabile in Chinese cattle (). In the Yak, the rete enables more efficient blood exchange and fulfills the critical function of a blood reservoir for blood supply to the brain [ 14 ]. Yak are well known to reside at high altitudes with characteristically low oxygen availability. This species’ rostral epidural rete mirabile is essential to efficiently shield, transport and stabilize blood flow and oxygen to the brain [ 14 ].\nVicugna pacos ) resides at high altitudes with low oxygen availability and endure extreme ambient temperature variability. It is speculated that the rostral epidural rete mirabile in the alpaca might aid in coping with hypoxia and extreme environmental temperature fluctuations [ Similarly, the alpaca () resides at high altitudes with low oxygen availability and endure extreme ambient temperature variability. It is speculated that the rostral epidural rete mirabile in the alpaca might aid in coping with hypoxia and extreme environmental temperature fluctuations [ 9 ]. This brings us back to our initial research question: Does the rostral epidural rete mirabile similarly fulfill this function in the giraffe, with its extreme head-to-heart distance aiding as a reservoir for brain perfusion and buffering blood rushing to the brain at the different head positions? This deduction was verified by our experiment, showing that rostral epidural rete mirabile length is indirectly proportional to both blood flow and pressure. The rostral epidural rete mirabile is, therefore, automatically altering the hemodynamics of cerebral blood flow using its structure.\n21,17,19, Studies conducted on selective brain cooling in artiodactyls by [ 17 35 ] describe the inimitable position of the rostral epidural rete mirabile where it lies in the cavernous sinus, at the base of the brain; indeed, it is positioned below the brain, within the cranium [ 4 36 ]. The position of the rostral epidural rete mirabile in the brain is significant regarding brain cooling and supplying blood efficiently to the brain [ 14 36 ]. Correspondingly, this position in the giraffe further supports the idea that the rostral epidural rete mirabile influences blood flow and pressure to and from the brain, which is especially important with the quick movement and position change of the head to ground level and again to a fully erect position. In a giraffe, the alternative pathway of blood to the brain via the vertebral arteries and the basilar artery that enters the circle of Willis in other animals does not exist. The basilar artery in the giraffe does not assist in the blood supply to the brain [ 8 21 ]. The maxillary artery through the rostral epidural rete mirabile is the dominant vessel supplying blood to the brain in giraffes.\n37, Another observation in a giraffe that differs from other Artiodactyls and Perissodactyls is the heart’s position concerning the brain. The pathway from the heart to the brain is notably straight, lowering resistance to flow and relieving pressure from the heart pumping 2 m against gravity to the brain. In a study on giraffes, [ 5 ] measured carotid blood flow and calculated the resistance to flow at head-up and head-down positions. Their results showed that when the head is raised, extracranial vasoconstriction takes place to prevent fainting. When the head is down, they suggest that blood flow to the brain is unrestricted. When looking at the position of the heart and the pathway from the heart to the brain, a notable straight path can be observed in comparison to other animals in which the heart is situated at an angle to the brain. The angle creates a bent path for blood flow from the heart to the brain, increasing arterial resistance [ 32 38 ]. The 2-m head-to-heart pathway of blood in giraffes has less resistance than, for example, sables and elephants’ pathways due to the straight pathway. This supports the idea of little or no control of blood flow to the brain in the head-down position. The observed notable bending of the maxillary artery before entering the rostral epidural rete mirabile in an otherwise straight pathway creates additional resistance to blood flow rushing to the brain when the head is lowered. The twisted arteries of the rostral epidural rete mirabile, the significant length of the rete arteries and the notable bend at the maxillary before entrance into the rete all in conjunction provide resistance to flow and therefore aid in the prevention of brain damage with the quick bending down from a fully erect to a ground position.\nHistologically, the maxillary artery prior to entering the rostral epidural rete mirabile structure and the intracranial maxillary artery post the rete are characteristically thicker-walled than the rete arteries. The muscular content of the rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries enables a greater extent of control. Again, resistance against blood flow is exerted by structural features, with blood moving from a thicker maxillary to the thinner rete arteries and again through the thicker intracranial maxillary into the circle of Willis. The rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries contain dense, smooth muscle indicating its ability to contract and expand. Expansion of the rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries will be restricted due to the limited space where it lies within the cavernous sinus, enclosed by bone. However, contraction of the rostral epidural rete mirabile network arteries will be possible due to the high muscular content. The ability of a large thick artery to contract in a limited space is restricted; however, the contraction ability of a network of various small arteries is more remarkable [ 39 ].\n24, We suggest that the pool of blood present within the rostral epidural rete mirabile meshwork, situated just beneath the brain, helps prevent the giraffe from fainting together with the carotid-vertebral anastomotic connection when the head is moved in a quick motion from ground level to fully erect. It is essential that the brain receives a continuous flow of blood and thus oxygen [ 10 33 ]. The blood in the rete can be pushed via the contraction of the rostral epidural rete mirabile arteries into the circle of Willis. Additionally, when the head is moved from ground level to fully erect, the force of gravitation pulls blood away from the brain, and the carotid artery enlarges with a parallel drop in pressure. The vertebral arteries are neighbored by connective tissue and back muscles as it courses through the transverse foramina and through the axis and atlas, avoiding enlargement. At this point, the vertebral arteries connect to the anastomotic artery that subsequently connects to the carotid artery. During the loss of pressure in the carotid artery, blood can be moved from the vertebral arteries via the anastomotic artery into the carotid artery that transitions into the maxillary artery, pushing blood into the rostral epidural rete mirabile and the circle of Willis. This pathway requires less pressure to be generated by the heart to supply adequate blood quickly to the brain during the movement of the head to a fully erect position. Fainting due to a loss of continuous blood flow to the brain is negated by the immediate source of blood to the cerebral arterial circle originating from the vertebral artery via the anastomotic artery into the carotid artery, as well as a small volume of blood contained within the rete arterial structure. The retained blood volume in the rete and the vertebral blood supply contributes to and ensures the crucial continuous flow of blood and thus oxygen to the brain to prevent fainting or even an ischemic cascade, owing to too little blood present in the brain [ 40 ]. This pathway of cerebral blood supply aid in temporary relief during the split seconds time-lapse, allowing the nervous system to instigate the heart to pump blood against gravity to reach the brain. Even though nervous stimulation is instant, a time-lapse of a few seconds occurs before the heart can pump blood to the brain in a fully erect position. A study by [ 40 ] on blood flow circulation in intracranial networks showed that due to the elasticity and subsequent cross-sectional area of arterial blood vessels, a relative blood volume is partly retained, slowing the pulsatile flow. The retained blood is released using blood vessel contraction [ 40 ]. The centripetal force exerted on the blood accumulated towards the head also adds to blood availability to the brain during the movement of the head from ground level to fully erect, at a critical moment, i.e., milliseconds.\nAdditionally, [ 35 ] investigated selective brain cooling and the influence of the rostral epidural rete mirabile in sheep. They concluded that brain blood flow and brain metabolic heat production differed contrary to the expected close relationship, as previously verified by [ 41 ]. Can this variation to the desired close relationship be due to the effect exerted by the rostral epidural rete mirabile structure on blood flow?\nThe combination of the results in our study gives a clear indication of the functional significance and efficiency of the rostral epidural rete mirabile in giraffes, as follows: (a) the structural arterial meshwork with characteristic turns and bends, and subsequently increased artery length through which blood flow must proceed before entrance into the brain, exert resistance to blood racing to the brain when the head is dropped to the ground; (b) the rostral epidural rete mirabile structure is positioned just beneath the brain, retaining a minimal amount of blood; (c) the brain is supplied mainly by the maxillary artery through the rostral epidural rete mirabile, with a rudimentary basilar artery not contributing to the brain blood supply and (d) the resistance to blood flow due to the structure and position of the rete when the head is in the upright position is counteracted by the unique carotid-vertebral anastomosis allowing an immediate cerebral blood supply.",
    "description": "The distinctive long neck of the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) entails functional difficulties brought about by the extended distance between the heart and the head. Blood must be circulated over 2 m from the heart to the brain against gravitational force. The natural movement of the head to ground level would result in a large volume of blood moving toward the brain with the force of gravity. Large blood volumes also rush to the brain during bulls’ fighting (necking), rendering the giraffe susceptible to possible brain damage. The natural movement of the head from ground level to fully erect would result in blood moving away from the brain with gravitational force. The lack of blood perfusing the brain can cause fainting. The giraffe, however, suffers neither brain damage nor fainting. What adaptations do giraffes have to counteract these challenges? The aim of this study was to investigate the functionality of the rostral epidural rete mirabile situated just beneath the brain and its possible contribution to successful circulation in long-necked giraffes. The unique rostral epidural rete mirabile structure significantly contributes to counteract physiological challenges. Turns and bends characterize this structural arterial meshwork and subsequently an increased artery length through which blood flow must proceed before entrance into the brain, exerting resistance to blood racing to the brain when the head is lowered to the ground. The brain is supplied mainly by the maxillary artery through the carotid rete, with a rudimentary basilar artery not contributing to the brain’s blood supply. The resistance to blood flow due to the structure and position of the rostral epidural rete mirabile when the head is in the upright position is counteracted by the unique carotid-vertebral anastomosis allowing immediate cerebral blood supply. The rostral epidural rete mirabile structure in giraffes is an essential feature balancing physiological difficulties arising due to the extensive heart-to-head distance and might fulfill the same function in other long-necked artiodactyls.",

    "maintext": "Thinking on your feet, working in small spaces, and accommodating a growing list of food intolerances all help to make the job of a superyacht chef one of the toughest gigs at sea. But the biggest challenge can be the provisioning of ingredients, especially in remote, hard-to-reach places.\nNatalia Sánchez, chef aboard Viva La Vida, says having to source top-quality produce wherever she is in the world is the most demanding—and interesting—part of her job. “Most of the time we’re in a different location each week, so I adapt my menu according to the location and try to use as much local produce as possible,” she told Robb Report.\nDuring a recent culinary competition among charter yachts, the crew actually dove to forage local shellfish. Courtesy Getty\nFrom seafood and fruit to vegetables and herbs, sourcing wild, seasonal and fresh produce has become so intrinsic to yachting that this year’s Superyacht Chef’s Competition at the annual MYBA Charter Show at Barcelona’s Marina Port Vell adopted “Foraged Fare” as its theme. The rules mandated a minimum of two foraged ingredients per course, with all dishes cooked and served on the yacht. Among the five judges were Michelin-starred chefs Antonio Mellino of Quattro Pazzi, Romain Fornell of Caelis and Shaun Rankin of Grantley Hall.\nSánchez, who grew up foraging in the Spanish countryside with her family, won first place in the “29m and under” (95 feet) yacht-length category. For her appetizer, she used royal sea urchin and dehydrated anemone that the crew dived for in a local reef. She followed with halibut al papillote with seasonal asparagus and wild dill for the main course and lavender cream-filled profiteroles with sage foam for dessert. Her menu was praised by the judges for its elegant simplicity.\n“Often, less is more, and that’s what we enjoyed about Sánchez’s menu,” says private chef and competition judge, Mike Jennings. “If you look at two and three Michelin-starred restaurants today, they’re serving a piece of beautifully cooked fish with a garnish next to it and little else. It’s about respecting the quality of ingredients.”\nNatalia Sánchez, chef aboard Viva La Vida, uses local produce to create new location-dependent dishes for charter guests. Courtesy Vida La Vida\nForaging has boomed in popularity since 2020, with professional chefs and enthusiastic amateurs alike heading into the countryside to gather mushrooms, herbs, and berries to bolster their plates and bypass the supply restrictions that occurred during the pandemic. Though sourcing for the superyacht’s galley is largely back to a pre-Covid regularity, the appetite for foraging has remained.\n“Reconnecting with the food that grows all around us is such an important skill,” says professional forager Emma Gunn, who lists sea buckthorn, wild garlic, and rosehip among her favorite foraged foods. “It makes us aware of what is available, and therefore care more about the environment.”\nAutumn is the best season for foraging, though the most common year-round wild edibles are roots, nuts, seeds, and depending on location, seafood and seaweed. More seasoned foragers among the superyacht set hunt for sorrel, which carries hints of sour green apple, and pepper dulse, a small, red algae that packs a powerful fishy, peppery, garlic punch.\nThe MYBA chef’s competition in Barcelona was devoted to foraging. Here, local fruits define the table. Courtesy Hemabejo\nChef Mary San Pablo aboard superyacht Marala used foraged sea purslane and scallop roe in her appetizer for her first-place-winning menu in the “51m and over” (167 feet and above) yacht category. “The best dish in the competition that reached the goal was San Pablo’s carabinero prawn starter,” says Jennings. “Everything about that dish—the texture and balance of flavor—was a real wow factor.”\nSan Pablo followed with quail, wild garlic, mushrooms, and wild rosemary for her main course, and a dessert of roasted apricot, caramelized lavender, and thyme sugar tart served with glazed rosehip, mulberry and lavender syrup.\nAnother reason chefs love to forage is that it forces improvisation. When Juan Carlos Gutièrrez, chef aboard Hemabejo, discovered he would be taking part in the MYBA competition just five days before the event, he turned to Barcelona’s abundance of mushrooms and wild fish for inspiration. He also brought Asian flavors inspired by his time in Japan and served a Ponzu Daikon Sauce made from seaweed with his tuna sashimi starter. For dessert, he combined local honey with nísperos, a seasonal Spanish fruit, all of which won him first place in the “30m to 50m” (90 to 164 feet) category.\nA signature dish by chef Juan Carlos Gutièrrez using a seasonal Spanish fruit called nisperos. Courtesy Hemabejo\n“Cooking haute cuisine in a superyacht galley requires organization and inventiveness,” says Gutièrrez. “In a big port like Barcelona you can find plenty of ingredients, but in somewhere like the Greek islands or the Caribbean you need to work with what’s available and getting the most out of the land is the best way to do that.”\nIn this new form of haute cuisine, the world is literally your oyster. “Foraging as a superyacht chef is the best way to discover new ingredients and to keep creating new dishes,” says Gutièrrez.",

    "maintext": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nKYIV, Ukraine — The fallout from the breach of a river dam along a front line of Russia’s war in Ukraine continued to wreak havoc on lives, livelihoods and the environment on Wednesday. When the Kakhovka dam ruptured on Tuesday, it sent a torrent of water from Ukraine’s largest reservoir into streets and homes downstream on the Dnieper River where tens of thousands of people live — in the thick of a combat zone where shelling regularly takes place.\nIt’s not clear what caused the breach: the structure had already been damaged in the war.\nUkraine’s government, which controls the river’s western bank and the city of Kherson, has accused Russian forces of blowing up the facility.\nOfficials in Russia, which controls the eastern bank for about the last 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) before the river reaches the Black Sea, has blamed Ukrainian military strikes.\nAdvertisement\nAuthorities and rescue workers on both sides stepped up efforts Wednesday to pull beleaguered residents to higher and drier ground.\nVolunteers in the city of Kherson buzzed around in inflatable motor boats to ferry people to safety or gather belongings left behind a day before.\nAround 3,000 people were evacuated from both sides of the river, and water levels were continuing to rise, officials said.\nOleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional administration, said some 1,700 people had been evacuated in Ukraine-controlled areas by early afternoon on Wednesday. Hundreds of calls for help were still pouring in to a government hotline, he said. The area has a population of about 42,000.\nOn the Russia-controlled bank, Moscow-appointed regional governor Vladimir Saldo said that 22,000 to 40,000 people remained in flooded areas. His deputy, Tatyana Kuzmich, said 1,274 people had been evacuated, and that the emergency response would last at least 10 days.\nAdvertisement\nThe head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, tweeted about “concerning developments” in the wake of the dam breach. He said he would travel next week to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which sits upstream on the edge of the reservoir.\nWater from the river is used for cooling at the nuclear plant — Europe’s largest — but officials have said the dam breach poses no immediate risk to its safety.\nThe office of Ukraine’s general prosecutor said water levels downstream from the dam rose as much as 12 meters (39 feet) above normal levels, causing flooding in more than two dozen villages and towns in liberated areas.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram that hundreds of thousands of people were without normal access to drinking water. Evacuation efforts in occupied areas had “completely failed,” he wrote, and Kyiv would appeal for international support.\nAdvertisement\nExperts warned about the possibility of an environmental disaster for wildlife and ecosystems. Some of the biggest minefields in Ukraine were inundated, raising the prospect that the explosives could be moved around.\nUkrainian authorities urged locals to drink only bottled water and avoid eating fish from the river, among other warnings.\nOperational since the mid-1950s under the Soviet Union, the dam and its associated hydroelectric power station are located about 70 kilometers (44 miles) east of the city of Kherson, and help bring electricity, irrigation and drinking water to a wide swath of southern Ukraine.\nWater in the reservoir is also channeled through a long canal that stretches to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed nine years ago.\nUkraine’s vast agricultural heartland, which is partially fed by the Dnieper River, is crucial to worldwide supplies of grain, sunflower oil and other foodstuffs.\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "maintext": "💡 Why did you want to go the super group path with DJ Edu?\nDJ Edu is not just one of the best and longest-serving DJs from Africa but he is by far one of the best DJs in the world. People don’t know he is also a producer and A&R and we’ve been working together since 2017. He actually leaked “Leg Over” after selecting it as a single, and I thought it wasn’t. So it’s a combination of experience and vibes.\n💡 Africa is dancing to Amapiano though it doesn't yet have a breakout global superstar unlike Afrobeats, does it need one?\nAmapiano is a dance music genre, so it’s not just about the single superstar but also about DJs/ producers and the clubbing experience. House music and techno started in underground clubs and became the most popular music genres in the world for a long time without necessarily driven by one single superstar. It was only with the advent of the celebrity DJ and the re-branding of dance music as EDM where that changed. I think we should stop obsessing about breakout global blah blah blah, and just enjoy the music. There are lots of South African superstar DJs and producers already killing it, not just in South Africa but also around Africa and already playing shows everywhere, even in Asia.\n💡 Has Afrobeats peaked?\nNo way! I think it’s really on its own trajectory and we will see some amazing growth in the next three years. The Afrobeats sound of today is not the Afrobeats of 2015 or 2016. It keeps evolving.\n💡 Should African artists sell their catalogs like their US/European counterparts have been doing recently?\nI love what’s happening with catalog sales because it cements music IP [intellectual property] as a valid asset class. There is so much opportunity for music from the 50s, 60s, from all over Africa. I’m even trying to buy catalogs.\n💡 How are you thinking about integrating language learning AI into your music-making process?\nTo be honest, I think it would be super cool to use AI to write the next ChopLife album. That would be sick! I’m all about embracing new tech.\n💡 What sector of tech investment are you most excited about in terms of its impact in African markets?\nThrough my VC fund, Zagadat Capital, I recently invested in Decagon, a company that trains engineers in Nigeria and pairs them with jobs worldwide. You have over 10 million smart, young Africans getting out of university each year in need of jobs. And, as such, Africa has the prospect to become the highest net exporter of technology talent.\n💡 What non-music TikTok are you addicted to?\nFood! You know how many recipes you can find on TikTok?!",

    "maintext": "As well as saving as much as possible, planning to reach financial independence should include a plan to grow your salary as much as possible.\nAfter many golden years in tech, times are getting tough. Talented engineers are being laid off through no fault of their own and, according to Blind, moving companies isn’t leading to the giant TC increases like it did previously (and that’s if you can find a new job at all).\nIt is not all doom and gloom though. If you are in the fortunate position to be not impacted by layoffs, it means you are likely in the right team at the right time, and your company sees value in what your team delivers. When times are tough, companies typically double down on the products they believe in and this should include the people.\nDon’t be afraid to ask your manager this. Understanding how your team fits into the companies plans now that you’re running a little bit leaner is a great question. Also, understanding what their priorities are and what their boss cares about is a great way to understand how you can add even more value.\n… And that leads us to the crux of this post. From speaking to colleagues at various companies, most are still doing annual salary reviews, but managers may have a smaller budget pot than in previous cycles. This means it is going to be competitive to get that raise. You can give yourself the best possible chance of success by doing three things:\nBeing the hardest worker in the room.\nDelivering a ton of the right value.\nMaking your managers job as easy as possible.\nBeing the hardest worker in the room\nAI Prompt: Being the hardest worker in the room as a software engineer\nJapan is often criticised for its work culture where employees work long hours and stay until their boss leaves. However I have found that American companies generally love people who are simply present, even if they say they don’t. Being around early, staying later and volunteering to take the on-call pager are all often cited characteristics of a “team player”. This might be followed up with a comment of “don’t make a habit of it though”, but trust me they don’t mean it.\nOf course, it’s even better if this extra time spent being present converts to more work delivered. I like to keep track of how many tasks I delivered in a week and try and beat it the next week. Its silly, but gamification like this can work really well for motivation.\nDelivering a ton of the right value\nAI Prompt generating value as a software engineer\nDelivering value is ultimately your job as a Software Engineer, however not all value is equal. Being able to identify the projects that have the biggest impact to the company is a skill in itself. However, there is a really easy and often overlooked way to figure this out… ask!\nAsk your manager, ask their manager, and if you have access, ask their manager too. The question can be simply “What’s the most important thing to our company right now that I could be helping with?”. Whatever their answer is, ensure you are working on something in this area and give the manager(s) regular updates on your progress. Ideally you should be doing this year round, but if you’re being more strategic, ensure you start doing this > 3 months before the review cycle opens.\nMaking your managers job as easy as possible\nAI Prompt: Making your managers job as easy as possible as a software engineer\nThis has two facets. Firstly, see the delivering a ton of the right value section but apply this same approach to problems your manger is facing. Perhaps they are trying to gather data about something and could benefit from a little automation.\nThe second facet is making it easy for them to make a case for your pay rise. To do this, I make a document of all the things I have accomplished since my last review and share it with my manager. This can be tricky, especially for Brits who are not very good at bragging. The way I approach it is just to be factual. “designed, and delivered x project on time that reduced our churn by 5%”, for example.\nWrapping Up\nEven if you do all of the above, there is sadly no guarantee of a pay rise. Manager’s really do have smaller budget pots than usual and may have been waiting to allocate it towards someone’s promotion, for example. Unlike previous cycles, I do not think moving around is the optimal move as job security is much more important than it ever was.\nDid you get a rise this year? What tips would you add?\n-The Fat Software Engineer",

    "title_page": "Agrochemicals | Free Full-Text | Fungicide Scent Pollution Disrupts Floral Search-and-Selection in the Bumblebee Bombus impatiens",
    "title_rss": "NULL",
    "maintext": "In addition to the consequences of direct exposure on behavior detailed above, agrochemicals can also modify behavior through indirect disruption of floral-sensory cues. Negative effects of odor pollution have been previously demonstrated in relation to air pollution modifying the structure of floral odor plumes [ 27 29 ]. However indirect effects are not limited to nitrous oxides and ozone degradation of odor plumes, as agrochemicals themselves can have strong scent signatures that additively modify floral odor information. Existing work has convincingly shown that agrochemical odor pollution is disruptive to bumblebee foraging behavior in lab contexts [ 30 31 ]. Early work found that a background of fungicide odor reduced successful navigation through a walking maze and increased the time it took for bees to locate a scented feeder within that maze. The same study showed that bumblebees preferred unpolluted foraging chambers as compared to fungicide- and fertilizer-odor contaminated chambers [ 30 ]. These findings could result from several possible mechanisms of disruption. First, the pollution background could have decreased the contrast of the learned odor relative to the environment. Second, the pollution background could have combined with the learned odor and caused a shift in odor blend structure. Finally, the odor pollution could have had a valence-based effect, where aversive components of pollution scent pushed back against attraction to the learned (appetitive) odor.\nMonarda fistulosa\nM. fistulosa\nA follow-up study used an associative odor learning paradigm (free moving proboscis extension reflex, or FMPER) to examine the impact of different pollution modalities on floral odor learning and recognition, specifically, testing background odor pollution during learning and recognition of floral scent, background odor pollution during recognition of (an already learned) floral scent, and point pollution presented in contrast to the floral scent during recognition. Three different fungicides (Safer, Scotts, and Reliant) were tested across all pollution modalities. All fungicides disrupted floral odor recognition in all pollution modalities, although patterns of response across fungicide concentration were not identical [ 31 ]. All three fungicides tested had angular distances from the learned floral odor () that were well above the discrimination threshold for bumblebees [ 32 ], so reduced contrast between floral odor and pollution background is not likely driving disruption. However, the differences in patterns of disruption across fungicides imply that multiple mechanisms may be at play. Scotts was disruptive at all concentrations and in all paradigms, while Reliant and Safer typically induced stronger disruption at lower concentrations. Taken together this implies that Scotts is likely aversive (a valence-based effect), while Reliant and Safer are not, based on findings that higher concentrations of these two fungicides did not disrupt responses toscent. Their capacity to disrupt scent recognition at lower concentrations suggests that when odors are at the threshold of perception, or liminally perceived, neural responses to fungicide odor may not be strong enough to encode a separate odor object and may instead modify responses to floral odor, resulting in an encoding shift. These data also imply that if neural identity of floral odor is shifted by liminal odor pollution, the ‘new’ odor is not readily generalized to the original. With loss of generalization, we can hypothesize that when testing the effects of odor pollution on foraging bumblebees we will see a disruption of odor-driven foraging behavior. To tackle this experimentally, we need to acknowledge that foraging behavior is not monolithic; rather, it is a constellation of sub-behaviors. Recent work proposed a framework for identifying and understanding foraging phases in terms of state and state-transitions (search (S), acquisition (A), navigation (N), S→A, N→A, etc.), forager-background (naive (n), experienced (e), primed (p)), and spatial scale (local (l), intermediate (i), distant (d)), with the understanding that different types of sensory information are relevant to different foraging phases [ 33 ]. The effects of agrochemical odor pollution are most likely to manifest in phases that utilize odor information, including, but not limited to: (1) search-to-navigation motivated by odor encounter at intermediate and local spatial scales (S→N(i,n/e/p); S→N(l, n/e/p)); (2) navigation at intermediate scales (N(i, n/e/p)); and (3) search-to-acquisition at local spatial scales (S→A(l, n/e/p)). Search-to-navigation represents scenarios where bumblebees are searching for novel resources in an environment and encounter a floral odor plume in isolation (an intermediate spatial scale) or in conjunction with a visual target (a local spatial scale), triggering either odor-guided navigation (N(i,n/e/p)) or visually-guided (N(l,n/e/p)) navigation. Sensory-guided navigation will become a local search once animals are in the vicinity of and receiving sensory cues provided by resolvable flowers (i.e., flower shape, nectar guides, scent marks). The choice to land on a flower is the search-to-acquisition transition. The experiments presented in this manuscript: (1) determine if previously tested fungicide-odors are consistently disruptive to floral scent recognition, using recognition of lily of the valley (LoV) scent in FMPER tests; and (2) bring this fungicide work into a foraging behavior context by testing for effects of fungicide odor pollution on sensory-guided navigation towards a learned cue (N(i/l,e)) and subsequent search-acquisition likelihood (S→A(l,e)) via a wind tunnel paradigm.",
    "description": "Bumblebees are valuable generalist pollinators. However, micro- and macro-stressors on bumblebees negatively impact both foraging efficiency and pollination efficacy. Given that colonies have a resource threshold for successful reproduction, factors that decrease foraging efficiency could negatively impact conservation efforts. Recently, agrochemical odor pollution has been shown to hinder floral odor learning and recognition in Bombus impatiens via an associative odor learning assay (FMPER). These results may have implications for the field foraging behavior of bumblebees. Building on this prior work, our study aimed to determine if negative effects of fungicides on associative odor learning and recognition scale up to negative impacts on actively foraging bumblebees. These experiments investigated whether the presence of a background fungicide odor (Reliant® Systemic Fungicide) impacts the location of a learned floral resource (lily of the valley-scented blue flowers) in a wind tunnel. Experiments were run with and without early access to visual cues to determine if fungicide odor pollution is more impactful on bees that are engaged in olfactory versus visual navigation. Fungicide odor pollution reduced landing frequency in both paradigms.",

    "maintext": "On this week’s episode, The Watch’s Radley Balko details the landmark decision of a Chicago judge not to allow firearm forensic experts to testify in a criminal case.\nBalko said the court’s decision comes after years of criticism aimed at the field of forensic pattern matching. He argues many of the techniques made famous on shows like CSI have little scientific basis. Many, he said, are based on little more than the best guesses of examiners who are mainly just eyeballing evidence.\nHe explained the idea that matching a mass-produced bullet to the mass-produced gun it was fired from, to the exclusion of all other guns, may well be impossible. Or, at the very least, we don’t have advanced enough techniques to pull it off with the level of certainty you’d want for evidence that could put somebody in jail for years or even decades. Indeed, Balko noted, most examiners cited as experts in court are unwilling to even submit to outside tests of their methods.\nPlus, Contributing Writer Jake Fogleman and I talk about how far the injunctions against President Biden’s pistol-brace ban extend. Jake also tells us about his latest rifle purchase, which is a bit of a throwback. And I give an update on how I’m liking the Phlster Enigma and appendix carry.\nYou can listen to the show on your favorite podcasting app or by clicking here. Video of the episode is also available on our YouTube channel. Reload Members get access on Sunday, as always. Everyone else can listen on Monday.",

    "maintext": "Watching almost universal condemnation of Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni for his vicious anti-gay laws, some of us with experience of his leadership felt a sad irony. Just take a close look at the man’s history, and his betrayal of almost everything for which he was once hailed as a leader of an “African Renaissance” — so lauded by the United States, no less.\nIt was somewhat reassuring to see President Biden denounce the awful nature of the law, with the death penalty prescribed for loosely defined “aggravated cases” of same-sex behaviour and life imprisonment for those convicted of homosexual relations. “A tragic violation of universal human rights,” said Biden, threatening sanctions and cuts to aid. Even an implacable foe of Biden’s, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, joined the chorus. “Horrific, grotesque, an abomination,” he said.\nYet any scrutiny of the passage that has led Museveni to this pariah status after 37 years in power exposes unmistakable, tell-tale signs of how the United States didn’t just turn a blind eye to the dictator-in-the-making, but positively backed him. The world’s number one superpower has blessed him as a favourite leader with aid, investment and support.\nThere’s never been a free and fair election in Museveni’s Uganda\nTo quote President Bill Clinton at the height of the lovefest with Museveni, celebrating Uganda’s leader alongside other Africa leaders who have since become dictators: “In a hundred years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and see here the beginning of an African Renaissance.”\nNow, Museveni rules over a country where a gay activist, Pepe Onziema, sits live on American TV choking back tears, explaining from Kampala: “We have nowhere to go, literally nowhere, without fear of being imprisoned or worse. We are illegitimate, so the law says, illegitimate for being the way we are and how we are known to be.”\nThis correspondent first met Museveni on a warm Saturday morning at his home in Kampala, in June 1980. Charming, softly-spoken, he issued a striking declaration of war. Sitting in his garden, he revealed on camera that he intended to fight the government that had taken power after the fall of the monstrous Idi Amin, even though he himself had served in it as Defence Minister. “I see dictatorship coming, and I will not sit back,” he announced with his customary smoothness as a communicator. “I’m a democrat. Freedom for all is my calling.”\nMemorably, whilst making us tea afterwards, he spoke thoughtfully about the continent and leadership. “The problem we have in Africa is not the people, but leaders who want to overstay in power,” he declared, waiting for a response. Then he filled the silence with: “you know I’m right.”\nThat tremendous self-belief, and his diplomatic skill in uniting longtime tribal enemies, led him to build an army of insurrection. He won a ruthless war against the government in Kampala in the five years that followed. Seizing power in 1986, his first act was to ban political parties and postpone any ideas of elections until later.\nThere’s never been a free and fair election in Museveni’s Uganda. He has won easily every time whilst his opponents are closed down, beaten up and even tortured by his paramilitary forces. Today, any meeting of more than three people is illegal, unless cleared first by his paramilitary police. So much for being a democrat. So much for freedom.\nYet in 1990s Washington, none of that seemed to matter. Scarred by deadly attacks on its peacekeepers in Somalia, then the genocide in Rwanda that left the superpower looking disengaged if not lost on the world stage, the Clinton administration re-cast itself.\nThe message was that Washington now represented an ally that understood a new generation of African leaders, who cared less about establishing full democracies, more about developing their countries and ridding them of famine, war, refugee crises and economic collapse. As Clinton gathered a handful of such leaders with Museveni as the host at Entebbe, Uganda in 1998, the New York Times reported that Uganda’s President was the standard-bearer of Washington’s policy.\nMuseveni’s government receives a billion a year in US aid\n“Museveni is a model leader,” the newspaper concluded, citing the way he restored political stability, boosted economic growth and beat back a dreadful HIV/Aids epidemic. “His style of self-reliant government, fiscal discipline and free-market economics has made him the darling of United States diplomats.”\nEver the savvy operator, Museveni responded by giving the Clintonites much-need breathing space on the issue of slavery, amidst calls for Clinton to make not just apologies, but reparations. Extraordinary to consider it now, but Museveni welcomed Clinton to Uganda by blaming Africans for slavery. “African chiefs were the ones capturing their own people and selling them,” he said. If anyone needed to apologise, he opined, it should be “those African traitors”.\nNo surprise that Museveni’s Uganda was handsomely rewarded. Under a package launched when Clinton visited, US aid and investment rose dramatically, totalling more than 50 billion dollars in the years that followed. Even today Museveni’s government receives a billion a year in US aid. Yet Uganda remains amongst the world’s poorest countries.\nOpposition leaders, such as musician-turned-politician Bobi Wine, say the clock is ticking on Museveni. The anti-gay law guarantees “he will end up in the dustbin of history”. He could well end up being remembered as yet another African democrat who turned dictatorial. Remember Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe and Ethiopia’s current leader, Abiy Ahmed — who was a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, believe it or not, before he launched a brutal war on the province of Tigray and its people.\nMaybe, but Museveni shows no sign of leaving anytime soon. Indeed, he cancelled term limits on the presidential job years ago so he could stay in power forever. Oh, and by the way, his son — an Army General who will be in the vanguard of the crackdown on homosexuality — says he’s going to run for the Presidency come any election day.\nI caught up with Museveni at the Clinton White House once again in the mid 1990s, reminded him of that Saturday morning in his Kampala garden, and asked him when he would hold a free and fair vote. He chuckled with disdain, mumbling that he would do so when the people asked him to. “You told me once ‘freedom for all’ was your calling?” I pressed. This time Museveni smiled with contempt.\n“Freedom for all, yes, for all those who deserve it,” he replied. As ever, Yoweri Museveni told himself he was right.",

    "maintext": "The attacks against Trump on immigration, abortion, and entitlements have another thing in common—they’re all coming from Trump’s right. It is, once again, easy to see the strategy here: The idea that voters like Trump’s policies but are skeptical of his temperament has long swirled around conservative circles, boosting the notion of “Trumpism Without Trump.” DeSantis’s own ascent as a possible successor was built around this. In Florida, he pursued a number of Trumpish policies but did so without as much noise and with a greater degree of competency. (The myth of DeSantis as a seamless operator has taken a number of hits recently, particularly after his disastrous Twitter Spaces campaign launch with Elon Musk.) These candidates bet that they can run to Trump’s right on both issues and, relatedly, authoritarianism: DeSantis’s “deep state” attacks essentially boil down to the argument that he can destroy the administrative state and Trump cannot.\nBut contrary to the “Trumpism Without Trump” thesis, all of these stances are disastrous in a general election: Public polling has swung heavily in favor of reproductive rights since the repeal of Roe v. Wade; Social Security and Medicare are extremely popular, as is the Covid-19 vaccine. Trump, moreover, has had success running against hard-line, bog-standard Republican positions on entitlements and trade, among other things. The rest of the GOP field in 2016 ran on typical Republican positions; Trump won in part because he didn’t, though it is worth noting that he ran to the right on immigration, one issue where the rest of the party has caught up. Similarly, the field—regardless of who is leading it—risks running into a very 2016 problem, in which Trump is allowed to run against everyone, all at once. This only reinforces what was perhaps his most salient argument during the 2016 campaign: that he is not like other politicians.\nYou need to win primaries before you can worry about a general election, of course. But even that approach doesn’t put Trump’s 2024 rivals in a much better strategic light. They overestimate how much voters like policy. In 2016, Republicans made the same mistake, emphasizing their constructive differences with the then reality TV star while he mercilessly mocked them—and romped to victory. If anything, four years of Trump (and three of Biden) have made GOP voters even more focused on vibes over vision: They want pugilists, not politicians who show up with binders. Indeed, DeSantis has bet that voters will respond to the effectiveness of his “woke”-focused policy agenda. But the thing that has really dragged him down in recent weeks and months is his limp, charisma-deficient personality.",

    "maintext": "European Central Bank officials called for interest rates to be lifted further — seeking additional reassurance on the inflation front as they look past more signs of weakness in the euro-zone economy.\nDutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said he’s “not yet convinced that the current tightening is sufficient,” telling lawmakers Wednesday in the Netherlands that “inflation could well remain too high for a long time and further rate hikes will then be necessary.”\nIreland’s Gabriel Makhlouf said “more work is needed from monetary policy in the short run,” while ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said there’s “more ground to cover” on borrowing costs. Exactly how much will depend on incoming data, Belgium’s De Tijd newspaper cited her as saying.\nNumbers, of late, have provided grounds for optimism.\nBoth headline inflation and the core gauge that policymakers’ have increasingly used as their guide moderated by more than anticipated in May, while an ECB survey published Tuesday showed consumers’ expectations for the trajectory of prices easing significantly.\nAt the same time, Europe’s economic outlook is looking shakier. Greece on Wednesday revealed a surprise decline in first-quarter output — further weighing on the 20-nation euro area, which is already being dragged down by Germany’s recession.\nThe bloc will release an updated reading of its own first-quarter performance on Thursday, with a Bloomberg survey suggesting it will just avoid the fate endured by its biggest economy by stagnating.\nECB policymakers have, in any case, stressed that regaining control of prices is essential to put growth back on track. Investors and analysts still predict quarter-point rate hikes next Thursday and in July — bringing the deposit rate to 3.75% from below zero in July, the steepest rise in borrowing costs since the euro was introduced.\n“A peak in underlying inflation would not be sufficient to declare victory: we need to see convincing evidence that inflation returns to our 2% target in a sustained and timely manner,” Schnabel said. “We are not at that point yet.”\nIn separate comments Tuesday, Knot said Europe is seeing second-round effects from higher energy costs — making it harder return consumer-price growth to the 2% target. He reiterated Wednesday that he’s “open minded” on the possibility of hiking in September.\n“The fact that we’re seeing inflation fall is welcome,” Makhlouf said. But “it doesn’t confirm to us that we’ve now done what we need to do to get inflation down.”\n© 2023 Bloomberg",

    "maintext": "It’s no secret at this point that Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ends on a ginormous cliffhanger — one we won’t get to see resolved till 2024.\nA lot of themes and plot points led up to that cliffhanger, but most importantly, there are two big revelations for Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) in this movie that spur along the final moments. Here’s the thing, though: Those two huge truths might contradict each other. Or they could fix each other, or they could be used as a giant jumping-off point for the franchise’s themes of fate and interconnection. Or all of the above! Let’s get into it.\n[Ed. note: This post contains major spoilers for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.]\nThe first big thing Miles learns in Across the Spider-Verse is that all the alternate versions of him across the multiverse — the Spider-People who form an elite reality-protection team — are linked not just by their spider abilities, but by “canon events” — big (often devastating) life moments they all experience, and more importantly, that they all have to experience. For instance, a police captain close to Spider-Man always dies, crushed by falling rubble while saving a child.\nMiles realizes this means his father, Jeff (Brian Tyree Henry) — who just recently got promoted to captain — is going to die in just a couple of days. Miles wants to save his father, but the interdimensional Spider coalition’s head honcho Miguel O’Hara (aka Spider-Man 2099, voiced by Oscar Isaac), says he can’t, and then traps Miles to keep him from interfering. Miles breaks out of captivity and attempts to return to his home universe, fleeing from an entire army of Spider-People.\nAs the chase escalates, Miguel reveals that Miles is actually the original anomaly, the reason for every glitch currently taking place across the multiverse. The radioactive spider that bit Miles and gave him his powers, per the usual Spider-Man origin story, came from a completely different universe. That universe doesn’t have its own Spider-Man now, and Miles was never supposed to be the Spider-Man of his universe, because without his presence, the Peter Parker in his world would still be alive. It’s a pretty shocking moment. But when Miguel snarls that Miles doesn’t belong among the other Spider-People, it hammers home what Miles’ mom told him earlier — that he should never let anyone tell him he doesn’t belong.\nBut herein lies the contradiction: If Miles isn’t his universe’s intended Spider-Person, why is his father on the chopping block? It could be that the radioactive spider forced the role on Miles, but if he’s enough of a Spider-Man that his canon is proceeding normally and he’s filling the usual Spider-role, why would his existence be such an issue to Miguel? If Miles is an anomaly who’s outside the normal Spider-canon, why can’t he just go ahead and save his dad and let his connection to the rest of the Spider-People dissolve? Wouldn’t that make everyone happy, albeit lonely? Miguel thinks breaking the canon would destroy Miles’ universe — would it also cause the whole multiverse to come crashing down?\nThis contradiction — either Miles is a canon Spider-Man, or he isn’t — is one of the bigger plot questions Across the Spider-Verse leaves unresolved. To be fair, by the end of the movie, the characters have more pressing issues to attend to than the minutiae of the Miles Paradox.\nThe Miles Paradox isn’t a plot hole. This movie is, after all, part one of two, and there are a lot of things for Beyond the Spider-Verse to dig into in 2024. Thematically, the contradiction between Miguel’s core truths about Miles challenges the notion of fate, determinism, and free will that’s built into the whole connected multiversal web. Plot-wise, the conflict could offer a solution to the Miles conundrum. Or it could make things much, much worse. Whatever the case, considering how much rich detail has gone into the Spider-Verse movies on every level, it’s very likely that this paradox is intentional and will play into whatever happens in Beyond the Spider-Verse.",

Credit: VCG/VCG via Getty Images.\nClean energy technology manufacturing, an essential cog in the energy transition, has rapidly expanded in the past year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA’s latest report, The State of Clean Energy Manufacturing, takes stock of how far along current developments are to reach net zero by 2050.\nIf all announced manufacturing projects are built, solar PV and battery manufacturing are on track to meet the 2030 needs of the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. However, the other three energy technologies the IEA analysed are lagging. Wind, heat pumps and electrolysers still need significant investments in manufacturing to make the target.\nWind, heat pumps and electrolysers not yet meeting the target is not necessarily a bad thing, according to the IEA. Data shows that in 2022, all technologies showed rapid growth compared with the year before. Battery manufacturing grew by 72%, solar PV by 39%, electrolysers by 26%, heat pumps by 13% and wind by 2%. Thanks to supportive policies, corporate strategies and growing demand, projects do not take long to develop. Especially compared with some other steps in the clean energy supply chain, such as the extraction of minerals. It takes, on average, 16.5 years to develop a mine from the discovery to the operational phase.\nAt the same time, manufacturing faces some of the same issues that other parts of the supply chain face; just a few countries are responsible for the majority of clean energy technologies manufacturing. China is currently responsible for more than half of the manufacturing of solar PV, batteries and wind technologies.\n“If we look at the projects that are currently under construction or planned worldwide, China is set to strengthen its leading position in key clean energy technologies,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, in a press release. “There is a need for effective international cooperation and further diversification to ensure secure and resilient technology supply chains, meet the world’s climate goals and enable all countries to enjoy the economic benefits of the new global energy economy.”\nThanks to new policies, namely the US’s Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Net-Zero Industry Act, the EU and the US would be able to slightly close the manufacturing gap with China if all planned projects come to fruition. According to the IEA, the EU would be self-sufficient for its battery, electrolyser and heat pump needs and the US for its battery needs in 2030.\nDuring the 49th G7 summit, held in May in Hiroshima, Japan, leaders of the world’s major economies emphasised the need to diversify all aspects of the supply chain and the significance of secure, resilient, affordable and sustainable supply.\n“The Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crisis have laid bare vulnerabilities in our supply chains, with significant impacts within and beyond our borders,” wrote the G7 leaders in a shared statement. “We share a goal to increase total investment in the clean energy manufacturing supply chain and accelerating the development and deployment of relevant technology.”\nThey added: “We put emphasis on scaling up investments globally into the manufacturing and installation of clean energy technologies and diversifying clean energy supply chains in a way that ensures they are secure, resilient, affordable, and sustainable, seeking to reduce and avoid undue dependency arising from geographically concentrated clean energy supply chains.”",

In an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order filed Tuesday (PDF), the SEC says it has made this decision to “ensure the safety of customer assets.”\nThe filing also claims that Binance has engaged in “violative conduct” for years in “disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets.”\nAs part of the order, Binance and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao are required to give up “possession, custody, or control over Customer Assets” within five days, with Zhao nor the company having the ability to transfer or withdraw assets from its customer wallets. It also asks that Binance transfer customers’ assets to “new wallets with new private keys, including new administrative keys,” and for the exchange to provide the SEC with a record of all new wallets with customer assets.\nIn the proposed order, ordinary customers may continue to redeem their assets “with the exception of and specifically excluding Customer Crypto Assets of any of the Binance Entities and otherwise subject to the prohibition that it not transfer Customer Assets for the benefit of any of the Binance Entities.”\nZhao responded to the motion by retweeting a post saying, “We are about to find out how solvent #Binance is.”\n“The SEC is being extremely aggressive in trying to freeze the assets of Binance pending the outcome of this dispute,” says Moish Peltz of the law firm Falcon, Rappaport & Berkman. “If the court granted this motion, it would likely have a material impact on the operation of the parties subject to the court order.”",

    "maintext": "Listen to the podcast on Apple or Google\nThe 2024 Republican presidential primary is not a traditional contest among independent political entrepreneurs. It is a chess match pitting Donald Trump against a deep-pocketed Never-Trump Cartel with vast media reach.\nThis Never-Trump Cartel is anchored by a Dark Money Koch Network, Big Pharma vax peddlers, and Democrat Wall Street billionaires who hedge their political bets by funding Republicans. This globalist troika is united in their love for open borders to import cheap labor and the offshoring of American factories and jobs to leverage the sweat shops and pollution havens of Asia.\nThe Never-Trump Cartel likewise includes corporate media conglomerates ranging from CNN and MSNBC to the RINO Right of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News empire. Rounding out the roster is a coterie of Silicon Valley venture capitalists and social media oligarchs, including Mark Zuckerbucks, who spent vast sums to defeat Trump in 2020 and the richest man in America who has offshored his largest Tesla factory to China, Twitter’s Elon Musk.\nThis Never-Trump Cartel will provide much of the Republican Primary fundraising, polling, and strategy. To understand its various gambits, consider two “favorite sons” contesting very early primaries.\nThe shadow “non-candidate” New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu in the bell weather second primary on January 30th and South Carolina’s Senator Tim Scott in the fourth primary on February 24th will use their home team advantages to try to blunt the “inevitability” of a Trump victory early on.\nScott has zero chance of winning the nomination but wants to maximize his chance of being picked for Vice President by either Trump or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, leader of the Never-Trump Cartel pack. As long as Scott drains votes from Trump, particularly early on in his home state, he will be lavished with cartel support.\nSouth Carolina’s “favorite daughter,” former Governor Nikki Haley, is likewise auditioning for VEEP but knows Trump would never pick her. She has simply bitten the Trump hand that fed her so many times.\nHaley’s slogan will be Trumpism without Trump. Her primary mission is to peel away Republican women from Trump. Ultimately, Haley hopes a strong showing in the primary may lead to VEEP redemption if Trump falters.\nThe Dark Knight Sununu harbors no such VEEP fantasy. Throwing punches from the sidelines, Sununu’s singular purpose will be to take away the New Hampshire Primary punch bowl from Trump. The cartel’s corporate media will provide him with a huge megaphone for his “anybody but Trump rants”; and he knows he need not formally be on the ballot to deprive Trump a big Granite State victory.\nABC’s designated Trump Hitter Chris Christie is on a similar kamikaze mission. This former New Jersey Governor is one of pack of former Trump Loyalists who switched sides after the November 2020 election, only to be rewarded with well-paid, Trump-bashing media gigs. Others include Trump’s Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney (CBS), Press Secretary Kayleigh McEneny (Fox), Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, and press aide Alyssa Farah (ABC).\nThat Christie is willing to give up his high-profile ABC gig to enter a race he can’t possibly win is the real tell in the cartel’s Never-Trump con game. This Pillsbury Doughboy of venom is the least popular of Republican candidates, with a rare “net negative” approval-disapproval rating. If ABC takes Christie’s smoldering cinder of a political corpse back for the general election run after he does his wet work on Trump, that network is ethically bankrupt.\nThere will be no shortage of other sacrificial pawns. Most prominent on the chessboard is former Vice President Mike Pence, a perennial Koch Network supplicant.\nPence is the Et Tu Brute Shakespearian figure in the eyes of Trump’s MAGA base for his turncoat role on January 6. His sole mission is to chip away at Trump’s Christian Right base by attempting to outflank Trump on the abortion issue -- never mind the damage this may do to any Republican candidate in the General Election forced to navigate the rocky feminist shoals of an over-turned Roe v. Wade.\nThe field will fill further – possibly with Wyoming’s former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Her blood feud with Trump over his open disdain for her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is palpable. Trump holds the neocon Dick Cheney directly – and rightly – responsible for his costly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the blood and treasure lost to America.\nIf the Never-Trump Cartel pollsters think Liz can drain votes from Trump, she’ll be in the race faster then a lie from Adam Schiff’s mouth. If Trump wins the nomination, Cheney may run as an Independent spoiler with full cartel backing.\nHere, we must remember that the Never-Trump Cartel cares not who wins the General Election. Once Trump is out, the Uniparty wins either way.",

    "maintext": "The Apple Vision Pro, unveiled Monday, could be a boon for startups in Seattle making AR and VR applications. (Apple Photos)\nEntrepreneurs developing augmented and virtual reality apps and games are optimistic that Apple’s new headset will turbocharge adoption of the technology, much like the iPhone did for mobile computing in 2007.\nApple unveiled the Apple Vision Pro on Monday after a lengthy development process. The new AR/VR headset is equipped with advanced sensors and cameras and is controlled by voice and gestures. Powered by “visionOS,” the headset is Apple’s first foray into spatial computing, or digital technology that can interact with the real world. The company showed off a number of use cases, including playing video games, watching movies, conducting work meetings, and more.\n“The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset should be evidence to developers and investors that spatial computing is here to stay,” said Dirck Schou, CEO of augmented reality job training startup Taqtile.\nOther tech giants including Microsoft and Meta have rolled out their own AR and VR headsets over the past several years but widespread adoption remains sluggish. Some believe Apple’s entry will change that.\nThe headset is priced at $3,499 and will be available next year.\n“This marks a new era for Apple being the first new product line in almost a decade and the first 3D interface for the company that has many use cases and apps within the Cupertino ecosystem that should distinguish the Vision Pro from the competition such as the Meta Quest,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.\nWe reached out to Seattle-area entrepreneurs building AR and VR tech to get their quick takes on Apple Vision Pro and its potential to drive the market forward. Read on for their answers.\nJoe Michaels, chief revenue officer at HaptX\n“I’m not going to lie. I got a few tears in my eyes watching the WWDC reveal of Vision Pro today. It was just beautiful to see how much care and thought they’ve put into this device. For eight solid years, I’ve been evangelizing VR/XR, dreaming about what may become possible in spatial computing. Today it felt like Apple took a huge step toward the dream.”\n“Sure, it’s only a starting point, and I hope over time enterprise versions of Vision devices will be compatible with more sophisticated touch feedback options like HaptX. But it’s so wonderfully Apple to respond to all the recent negativity over XR with a product that screams ‘damn the naysayers, just ship something so cool we’ll make a new market.'”\n“It’s all about virtual screens. While most others in the market are trying to build social virtual worlds, Apple is betting that the Vision Pro’s first killer use case is virtualizing many of the screens we encounter in our day-to-day lives. Bringing in 3D models into your space was framed almost as an afterthought because how many people actually have 3D models to work with?”\n“What they announced today is a new foundation, solving many of the issues plaguing the AR/VR market, while at the same time integrating it with their current offerings, bringing most/all iPad apps along with it. They aren’t trying to pitch us some sci-fi future, but show us how we can interact with all of the stuff we already have in an innovative new way.”\n“As the name indicates, this is not a consumer device, but a professional product targeting designers and developers looking to get into spatial computing. I, for one, will be getting the device as soon as it is released.”\nDirck Schou, CEO of Taqtile, and Lance Williams, vice president of marketing",

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\nFoo Fighters have seemingly confirmed their identity as Glastonbury 2023’s mysterious band, The ChurnUps.\nOn Tuesday (6 June), the rock band, fronted by singer and guitarist Dave Grohl, tweeted a photo of a handwritten note that included a subtle reference to the secret group taking over the Pyramid Stage on Friday (23 June).\n“Hey. It’s been a while. Now that we’ve returned from our first run of shows, I felt compelled to reach out and thank you all for being there for us,” the message began.\n“Every night, when I see you singing, it makes me sing harder. When I see you screaming, it makes me scream louder. When I see your tears, it brings me to tears. And when I see your joy, it brings me joy. But, I see you... and it feels good to see you, churning up these emotions together.\n“See you soon,” signed Grohl.\nSeveral fans responded to the post, convinced the “churning up” line was a hint at their upcoming appearance at Worthy Farms, Somerset.\n“See you at Glastonbury!” one commented.\n“Are you winding us up with that ‘churning up’ comment?” a second asked. “Coz do NOT toy with my Glasto emotions like that.”\nAnother added: “Looking forward to seeing you at Glasto again.”\nLast week, following the unveiling of this year’s headliners, Arctic Monkeys, Guns N’ Roses and Elton John, a new addition by the name of The ChurnUps was revealed.\nHowever, nobody had any idea who they were, as they have no existing footprint online, leading many to believe it was a cover for a surprise guest.\nThe most popular guess among festivalgoers has been Pulp, with the theory that if you churn something up, it becomes pulp.\nAlthough Grohl has also been another major speculation, given that the founding member was once in a band named Churn. However, many assumed Grohl was a red herring.\nGlastonbury 2023 runs from Wednesday 21 June to Sunday 25 June. Read here for a full lineup and stage schedule, and for those not attending the festival, find how can watch at home here.",

    "maintext": "An F-16 like those that intercepted the Citation jet that flew to its doom over Washington D.C. this weekend. (Getty Images.)\nThis post is about two news-making sad outcomes, with a set-up for discussion of a longer-term ongoing challenge.\n1) Yesterday’s sonic boom over Washington DC.\nAs a kid, I thought that sonic booms were just part of the daily soundscape. My K-12 schools were underneath the flight path for the gigantic Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California. In those days of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the buildup to the Vietnam War, we’d hear sonic booms day and night—more and more frequently, the tenser Cold War relations became.\nIn modern urban life, ambient noise is rising but sonic booms are rare. Thus much of the DC area noticed yesterday afternoon when F-16 fighter planes broke the sound barrier over the Capital, on their way to intercept a Cessna Citation jet that crashed shortly afterwards in rural Virginia.\nDeb and I had just arrived in DC a few hours earlier, after two weeks in California, and somehow we didn’t hear the booms. But since then we’ve learned more about the incident. Here are the main points:\nWhat happened: The big picture.\nThe Citation business-jet airplane, with four people aboard, flew from Tennessee to its intended destination on Long Island. The four people were: the pilot, the daughter and the 2-year-old granddaughter of the plane’s owner, and a nanny. The takeoff site was Elizabethton, a small airport in eastern Tennessee, and the destination was Islip, near a family house in the Hamptons on Long Island.\nThe plane made its northward course without apparent problem, and then seemed to turn to line up for a landing at Islip. But it never descended below 34,000 feet—a jet’s cruising altitude, and very far above the approach altitude for a landing. It overflew Islip and headed straight back over hundreds of miles toward the DC area. Planes flying at this altitude are required to be in constant touch with air traffic controllers. Reportedly this plane was “NORDO”—no radio, and no contact with anyone else.\nThe Citation finally crashed in a wooded area some 150 miles southwest of DC, on the hilly border between Virginia and West Virginia. This is where it apparently ran out of gas. On the map below, the blue arrow indicates the outbound course; the yellow arrow is the turning point, as if the plane were setting up for landing at Islip; the green is the straight-line path over Washington; and the red is where the plane apparently ran out of fuel and spiraled to the ground\nVia FlightRadar24, the track of the plane toward its destination, and then to its demise.\nHere is a closer look of the plane’s final descent. At the very end it was heading toward the ground at nearly 500 miles per hour, and losing altitude at over 20,000 feet per minute. This is a far more sudden descent than an airline passenger would normally ever experience. We can hope that all aboard were unconscious at this point.\nTrack of the final minute of the plane’s spiral, via ADSB Exchange .\nWhy did this happen?\nAs with everything in the aviation world, no one knows for sure, barely a day after a crash.\nBut several aspects fit the pattern of past aviation tragedies.\nOne is pilot incapacitation. Some news reports say that when the F-16s neared the plane they saw a pilot slumped over and unresponsive at the controls.\nWhy just one pilot in the cockpit? A plane like this would normally have two, but operators can apply for a “Single Pilot Waiver.” And what happened to this one pilot? A long-shot possibility is a heart attack or other sudden disabling event. That’s possible—though presumably the two other adults aboard the plane would have tried in the following hours to get on the radios or otherwise appeal for help.\nThe more likely explanation is that something went wrong with the pressurization system and oxygen supply aboard the plane, in a way that disabled everyone aboard.\nThe plane spent several hours above 30,000 feet in altitude. That high up, there’s simply not enough oxygen for people to function. Survive, maybe. Operate an airplane, no.\nDecades ago, in preparation for a demo flight in the rear seat of an Air Force F-15, I was required to go through altitude-chamber training. You sat in a little enclosed cell, and minute by minute the oxygen was cut off—as if you were ascending into the “flight levels” and breathing only as much oxygen as the surrounding air would supply.\nEvery minute, you were supposed to write a few words on a note pad. By the time we got to the equivalent of 20,000 feet, my notations were a scrawl. By 30,000 feet, I could barely hold the pen. The shock was that I didn’t realize it at the time. The power of hypoxia is to reduce your performance and your self-awareness more or less in parallel. When I later saw a video of my few minutes in the chamber, it was hard to believe how semi-unconscious I had become. It was a physiological version of the Dunning-Kruger effect. I was being lobotomized, all unaware.\nIt left a permanent impression. Thanks largely to that experience, in my time as a small-plane pilot I have done my best to avoid extreme altitudes. Going coast to coast? Plan a path either north or south of Colorado’s dreaded Rocky Mountains. Need to go briefly to 10,000 or 11,000 feet to get through passes? Look obsessively at your fingernails, to be sure the nail-beds are not turning blue. Always have emergency oxygen aboard. And always look for the lowlands.\nOf course staying low is not an option for business jets like the one in this tragedy. They are designed to fly in the 30,000-foot range.\nWas there an “explosive decompression”—some mechanical fault that suddenly exposed all aboard to non-survivable thin air? Was it an insidious slow loss of oxygen, so gradual that no one noticed?\nWe don’t know yet. The most gruesome possibility is that only the pilot had a medical emergency, leaving the others in helpless awareness that the plane was going down. The more likely scenario is that whatever affected the pilot affected all the others too. Hypoxia makes you drowsy. So it’s more likely that they all were … asleep. This would be similar to a famous parallel case, which killed the golfer Payne Stewart and five others in 1999.\nWhy did they fly over DC?\nThis is another seeming similarity to the Payne Stewart tragedy. Stewart’s plane left Orlando for Dallas—and after the pilot passed out from decompression, it kept on going, until it ran out of fuel over the Dakotas. That seems to match the latest crash as well.\nBased on what we know now, it appears that the plane was supposed to land at Islip, KISP, on Long Island. The reported winds at the time were from the southwest. That would favor a landing on Islip’s Runway 24—a long, broad, very comfortable runway.\nThat is presumably what the pilots would have prepared for.\nWhy does this matter? Because—based on what we know now—it appears that the plane lined up on a heading of 240 toward Islip, as if getting ready for a landing on Runway 24. But then it kept on going, never descending from 34,000 feet, and flew in a bee-line on a 240 heading until it ran out of gas and crashed. The straight-line 240 course would explain the route over DC and beyond. [UPDATE: There is additional reason to think this is what happened, as explained in a footnote below.\n]\nWhy didn’t the pilot notice? Why didn’t his and the others’ oxygen masks immediately deploy? Why didn’t he manage to descend, to a more benign altitude? Why didn’t anyone say anything over the radio? Might an oxygen problem have happened very early in the flight, soon after takeoff?\nWe don’t know now, and might never know. Again let’s hope that everyone spent those last moments in slumber.\nShare\nWas this any kind of threat?\nExcept to the people aboard, No.\nBack in the 1990s, the skies over DC were like any other big-city airspace—and like New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco even now. You could fly pretty much where you wanted, as long as you carefully obeyed instructions from the air traffic controllers and kept precisely to your assigned altitudes and headings. In those innocent days, I did a number of training and sight-seeing flights along the Potomac River past the Capitol, and up the Anacostia on the east side of town.\nIn DC that all changed after the 9/11 attacks. Airports in the region were locked down for months. Even now, you need special clearance to fly anywhere near DC.\nStill, despite the warnings and penalties, some private flights manage to blunder their way into these restricted zones.\nTo fly in the area, you have to take periodic refresher courses—including on what to do if intercepted by military jets.\nFrom FAA instructions on what to do if you are surrounded by F-16s. You have to pass regular tests on procedures like this. In this graphic the errant aircraft looks like a big airliner. In reality the controllers are more worried about smaller planes going astray.\nAs a technical matter, the plane that crashed this weekend was so high when it passed over DC that it was not officially violating the airspace. The DC-area security restrictions go up only to 18,000 feet. The Citation was nearly twice that high when it passed over the Capitol and the White House, so presumably the F-16s were sent not to deter it but to see what was going on.\nOn some pilot message boards, there was early rumorology that the F-16s had finally shot down the Citation. That appears to be paranoia. The plane flew as long as it could, then it spiraled earthward—presumably because one engine quit just before the other, giving it unbalanced thrust at the end.\nWhat do we learn from this tragedy? Mainly that it was a tragedy—as opposed to a threat. Maybe we’ll learn something further about oxygen systems. Maybe about unknown risks of single-pilot operation. Maybe about something no one has figured out so far. For now, this is sad and tragic. Sympathies to all involved.\nShare\n2) This weekend’s business news out of Fresno.\nStarting eight years ago, Deb and I have written frequently about the business, civic, and cultural renaissance underway in Fresno. Yes, that Fresno.\nHere is a sample article, from 2015. And another from around the same time, about the city’s sassy motto: “Unapologetically Fresno.”\nOne of the central figures is this movement has been the startup tech company Bitwise—and its co-founders and leaders, Jake Soberal and Irma Olguin Jr.\nWe’ve known them; we’ve liked them; we’ve been drawn to their story and their example. We hired them to do web-site design for our little NGO. We wrote about them in our book. Mitch Kapor and Freada Klein did in their book as well. Here’s another illustration, from a piece I did two years ago, about Bitwise expanding its “inclusive opportunity” model from Fresno to other underdog, “left-behind” cities like Toledo, Ohio. And this, two years before that, about the company’s nationwide ambitions.\nJake Soberal and Irma Olguin Jr of Bitwise, in happier days. (Bitwise photo.)\nThus it is with profound sadness, puzzlement, disappointment, and sadness again that we saw this weekend’s news that Bitwise has suddenly ceased operations and laid off more than 900 employees, and that its board has fired the two founders, Soberal and Olguin, for apparent financial mismanagement.\nI don’t know anything more than what has been reported—mainly through Tim Sheehan and his colleagues at the Fresno Bee. And this, about ripple effects in cities like Buffalo.\nI’ve sent queries to our many friends in Fresno, and will report back when I hear more. We’re reported on many stories of ongoing success, for instance with our friends at the Mississippi School of Mathematics and Science. We feel obliged to report the setbacks as well.\nAnd speaking of setbacks, next up in this space we’ll return to the abyss known as Coverage of the Debt Ceiling. I’ll save that for next time.",

    "title_rss": "NULL",
    "maintext": "Межигір'я – одна з найбільших \"пам'яток\" режиму Віктора Януковича. Як за масштабами поцупленої землі чи вартістю дорогоцінного оздоблення, так і за місцем в українській історії.\nРозкішна резиденція, розташована на березі Київського моря, стала легендою ще на початку президентської кар'єри Януковича. Це була легенда про безмежну владу, впевненість у безкарності та хворобливе марення всім найдорожчим, із несмаком заховане за двома рядами високих парканів.\nУ 2014-му, коли зі втечею керманичів \"Сім'ї\" загорожі відчинились, Межигір'я набуло нового значення. Воно стало символом падіння режиму, важкої, але впертої боротьби народу проти узурпаторів.\nУ перші дні після перемоги Революції гідності журналісти й активісти рятували з Київського моря чорну бухгалтерію Януковича. Пізніше журналісти-розслідувачі проводили тут MezhyhiryaFest. Це було відлуння старої традиції, коли представники ЗМІ приїжджали під двері президента на своє професійне свято, 6 червня, нагадуючи про обіцянку показати резиденцію.\nПротягом довгих років після Майдану Межигір'я встигло отримати ще один образ. Воно стало офіційним доказом злочинів режиму. Та попри це залишалось уособленням інституційної слабкості.\nПостмайданна влада рік за роком не могла довести до вироків справи проти регіоналів. А заразом і знайти місце арештованому маєтку. Ним продовжували керувати самооборонівці, юридично облаштованого там парку просто не існувало.\nНавесні 2022-го повномасштабне вторгнення Москви не оминуло колишній приватний рай проросійського президента. Резиденція стала прихистком для мешканців довколишніх сіл і потрапила під обстріли.\nЛише під кінець першого року великої війни Україна спромоглась відібрати Межигір'я у формальних власників – його конфіскували у власність держави. Навесні 2023-го воно знову відкрило свої двері для відвідувачів.\nЩо відбувається із маєтком зараз? Як Межигір'я переживає повномасштабну війну? І що буде далі з багаторічним символом української корупції?\nВторгнення\n9 травня 2023 року до берега Київського водосховища у Вишгороді причалили рештки пілота російського гелікоптера Мі-24, 27-річного Романа Манкішева.\nВ лютому минулого року старший лейтенант Манкішев вилетів із Білорусі на Київ, щоб відсвяткувати на Хрещатику радянський День Перемоги. Але щось пішло не так.\nВ Межигір'ї, до якого росіяни не дійшли всього шість-сім кілометрів, розповідають:\n\"Той борт збили 24-го. Льотчик плив з парашутом. На березі на нього вже чекали наші газонокосарники. Але він десь метрів 200-300 не доплив – потонув. От тепер вийшов 9 травня на \"парад\".\nПро те, як колишню резиденцію Януковича у лютому-березні 2022 року задіяли в обороні столиці, тут поки що розповідають без подробиць. Посилаються на правила та обмеження воєнного стану.\nНа \"об'єкті Хонка\" залишились майоріти державний та червоно-чорний прапори\nПерша ракета поцілила в територію Межигір'я 24 лютого. Друга повітряна атака була на початку березня – літак скинув дві бомби.\n– Одна поцілила у вишку, зруйнувала обладнання мобільних операторів, – ділиться комендант Межигір'я Денис Тарахкотелик. – Інша пішла мимо. Потім ще \"Гради\" падали в трьохстах метрах від нас.\nУ нас від обстрілів постраждала дорога. Трошки її вже заасфальтували, але не капітально.\nУламки російського гелікоптера на території Межигір'я\nДенис Тарахкотелик обіцяє розказати подробиці того, як Межигір'я брало участь у захисті столиці, але тільки після перемоги\nТарахкотелик каже, що після вторгнення Російської Федерації він не давав Януковичу жодного шансу на повернення.\n– Особисто в мене була віра на 101%, що його тут не буде, – згадує активіст. – Коли поруч розгорнулася 72 бригада, стало легше. Ми вірили: буде все зроблено, щоб Янукович сюди не потрапив.\nУ цієї віри немає логічних пояснень. Але ж ми – майданівці, пам'ятаємо, як вже десь 17 лютого (2014 року – УП) був дуже складний момент, коли з'являлося відчуття, що люди можуть розійтись. Все одно була віра, яка допомагала боротися та йти вперед.\n– Єдине, що було: думки, що Янукович в теорії може потрапити у Сухолуччя (ще одна його колишня резиденція – УП), – продовжує Тарахкотелик. – Але він і туди не потрапив. Лише була інформація про Царьова в Козаровичах (він давав інтерв'ю пропагандистам РФ з Катюжанки – УП).\nЕлінг для яхт, куди влучила ракета\nКуточок марнославства\nЧи ходив Янукович по дому в капцях? Чи сам застеляв постіль? Якою зубною пастою користувався?\nЧи грає \"Владимирский централ\" його шарманка, яка коштує 460 тисяч євро?\nЗа дев'ять років роботи екскурсоводом у Межигір'ї Юлія Капіца звикла до різних питань. Фінансист за освітою, вона прийшла сюди з Майдану, щоб долучитися до проєкту YanukovychLeaks.\n– Все це було для мене тимчасовим, але затягнуло, – каже вона репортерам УП всередині \"Хонки\", колишньому будинку Януковича на 2600 \"квадратів\". – Я вросла (в Межигір'я – УП) так, що мене тут трошки хворобливо турбує абсолютно все! Будь-яка маленька царапина.\nПотрапити з Юлією на екскурсію в \"Хонку\" можна за 500 гривень\nЛюстра з італійського кришталю. Вага – 1250 кілограмів. Приблизна ціна – 1 мільйон доларів\nНавіть сьогодні Юлії доводиться руйнувати міфи. Ні, \"золотий батон\" – це радше вигадка. Якщо він і був, то його ніхто з активістів та слідчих не бачив. Так, \"золотий унітаз\" – не золотий: якщо там щось і було, то трохи позолоти.\nНі, \"Хонка\" – це не президентська резиденція. Її Янукович почав будувати, коли був прем'єром за часів президента Ющенка.\n– Дехто досі думає, що назва \"Хонка\" від слова \"шконка\" (\"спальне місце\" на тюремному жаргоні – УП), – посміхається Капіца. – Але Honka – це назва фінської фірми, яка робить сосновий брус.\nНе знаю, хто почав моду на продукцію саме цієї компанії, але Honka є у Юри Єнакієвського, Порошенко має її.\nПро будні Януковича Юлія розповідає у більярдній, де дуже багато дерева. На стелі та стінах німецьке різьблення. В кутку – та сама механічна шарманка.\nЮлія каже, що невідомо, чи є ця шарманка подарунком, чи її купив сам Янукович\nБільярдна Януковича з фінськими стінами та німецькою стелею\n– Це лімітована серія, таких двадцять у світі. Інструмент – сучасний, але зроблений у швейцарській майстерні, яка заснована 1865 року, за технологією тих часів, – розповідає Юлія.\nВерді, Шопен, Штраус, Армстронг – у плейлисті шансону немає. Але, каже Капіца, за великі гроші, клієнт міг би замовити додатковий \"валік\" з будь-якою мелодією.\nЧетвертий президент України був любителем аматорського співу та феноменальних понтів.\nУ \"Хонці\" застиг білий рояль. Інструмент фірми Steinway & Sons, випущений у 2010 році до 70-річчя Джона Леннона, в лімітованій серії іде під другим номером. Всього на світі таких 25. Останній в серії – найдешевший. Чим ближче до першого номеру, тим дорожчий рояль.\nГраючи на лімітованому роялі, Янукович міг відчути себе Джоном Ленноном\nСеред меблів немає антикваріату, але вони виглядають, як музейні експонати\n– Рояль повністю відтворює той, що був у кліпі \"Imagine\" з Йоко Оно, – каже Юлія Капіца. – Місце, де він стоїть, я називаю \"куточок марнославства\": французька порцеляна, на підлозі паркет з \"Раками\" – знаком Зодіака Януковича...\n– То він на цьому інструменті \"Мурку\" грав? – питає репортер УП.\n– \"Хонка\" не призначена для сабантуїв, – відповідає гід. – Тут був тільки він та коханка. Вечірки проходили на \"Галеоні\", кораблі-ресторані. Там була сцена, гримерка, все обладнання та інструменти.\nЦей рояль в тих концертах участі не брав. Але на ньому був скол, його замазали білою фарбою. Тому в мене є припущення, що до нього Янукович не відносився як суто до \"музейного експонату\".\nЧому вам варто приєднатися до Клубу УП? Правда – це не завжди наші з вами переконання, якими б порядними та шляхетними вони не були. Щоб знайти правду, треба вміти чути не тільки себе, а й інших. В пошуках правди журналісти УП виходять за межі затишних столичних офісів, сторінок соцмереж та власного світогляду. Ми багато їздимо країною, щоб відповісти на питання: \"Яка вона, справжня Україна? Чого ми прагнемо та що робимо не так?\". Підтримуйте Клуб УП, якщо вважаєте, що це важливо. Євген Руденко – журналіст УП Приєднатись\nВід 966 до 2022\nБільшість речей, які насправді мали цінність як експонати, забрали до Художнього музею ще в 2014-му. Відтоді і до 2022-го це була остання успішна спроба держави знайти корисне місце \"спадку\" Януковича.\nХоча цінність тутешніх місць накопичується ще з кінця першого тисячоліття нашої ери.\n\"Починаючи з 966 року, є перші спогади про Межигірський монастир, – розказує Тарахкотелик. – Тут було поховано приблизно 1,5 тисячі козаків у пізнішу добу, а також монахів, священників\".\nМежигір'я залишається квітучим ландшафтним парком. Але часом тут буває дуже багато мошок та комарів\nПісля Майдану маєток був арештований як доказ у кримінальній справі. А парк, облаштований майданівціями на території символу корупції, продовжував існувати у \"сірій зоні\" українського права та економіки.\nУ 2018 здавалось, що держава знайшла інструмент, щоб дати раду Межигір'ю – передати його в управління бізнесу. Та жодна відома компанія чи менеджмент не взялася за це. Адже резиденція будувалась для того, щоб витрачати на неї кошти, а не заробляти.\nТарахкотелик порівнює площу ввіреного йому майна, 142 га офіційно, 160 – за підрахунками активістів, із \"Софіївкою\" в Умані. Але додає: на відміну від відомого дендропарку, Межигір'я проєктувалось під одну людину.\n\"Починаючи від наповнення води у цих озерах – воно штучне, їх треба підтримувати, качаючи воду зі скважин. Фільтрація води створена природно, тече через очерет, очищається – туди її треба закачувати\", – пояснює комендант.\nБіля \"Хонки\" чимало берізок, які, вочевидь, нагадували Януковичу про його ментальну батьківщину\nБагато що змінилось з початком великої війни. Одна з перших змін, яку називає Тарахкотелик – це борги:\n\"Борг за все: електрику, зарплату людям. Брали в борг на те, щоб годувати тварин. Утримання Межигір'я у 2022 не припинялося, а кошти нам ніхто не давав. Мало того, в нас ще був шматок боргу з 2020 року\".\nЧи їв цей страус із рук Януковича, невідомо\nПід час війни парк тривалий час не міг заробляти, оскільки був закритий для відвідувачів. Та й кількість працівників зменшилась майже вдвічі. Дехто, як колишній екскурсовод хонкою Петро, пішов воювати.\nНині у керманичів Межигір'я боргів на 58 мільйонів. Це приблизно річний бюджет парку – до війни і подорожчання долара.\nЧитайте також: Кому дістались \"сімейні\" скарби Януковича. Частина 1. Межигір'я\nМежигір'я в законі\nПід час великої війни проблема Межигір'я мала потьмяніти на загальному фоні. Так і сталося. Та лише тепер у резиденції з'явився реальний шанс легалізуватись.\nЗ'явився новий механізм конфіскації активів у підсанкційних росіян та їхніх поплічників. І саме так Межигір'я нарешті офіційно опинилось в руках держави. У грудні 2022 суд відібрав у Януковича маєток і інше майно.\nДалі його, на паперах, передали у Фонд держмайна. Кабмін схвалив проєкт закону, який має надати резиденції статус парку-пам'ятки садово-паркового мистецтва. А Мінкульт пообіцяв передати в музеї, пограбовані росіянами цінності з маєтку – картини, ікони, книги, предмети інтер'єру й декору.\nЗразок наївного мистецтва на в'їзді у Межигір'я\nТа в самому Межигір'ї про все це знають лише з новин.\n\"Нам складно проінформувати суспільство, що зараз відбувається. Нам ніхто нічого не каже\", – обурюється Тарахкотелик.\nВін ставить доречні питання. Чи має держава детальний опис всього того майна, яке вона конфіскувала? Чи впевнена у статусі численного рухомого майна: від люстр до статуй з італійського мармуру? І як планує давати раду невеликій частині землі, яка все ще перебуває в приватній власності втікачів?\nІталійські статуї навпроти \"Хонки\"\nФонд держмайна повідомив УП, що лише в другій половині травня 2023 року перереєстрував маєток за державою. Але з нього досі навіть не зняті арешти – це має зробити суд, звернення до якого ФДМУ ще готує. Так само все ще не провели інвентаризацію майна.\nПро близьких до Януковича \"сусідів\", яким все ще належать шматки території, ФДМУ знає. І готове судитися з ними, щоб виборювати територію в суді.\nФонд уже зустрічався з нинішнім комендантом \"Межигір'я\" і \"повідомив про плани\". Про них держава поки каже стриманою бюрократичною мовою:\n\"Зараз ФДМУ опрацьовує можливі юридичні механізми, які можна буде застосовувати для збереження, а також ефективного та прозорого управління цими активами до передачі їх до парку-пам'ятки садово-паркового мистецтва\".\nЗамість \"чоловічих іграшок\" в Межигір'ї тепер дитячі\nБродіння\nКоли у 2010 році Янукович почав будівництво \"Хонки\", російському пілоту Роману Манкішеву, рештки якого нещодавно віддало Київське море, було п'ятнадцять.\nЧи змінив би світогляд офіцер РФ, якщо б п'ятнадцять місяців тому, він зміг доплисти до Межигір'я живим? Чи зрозумів би масштаби власної дурості?\nЧи був би й далі готовим померти за владу і статки Путіна, побачивши наочно, як жив президент \"всього лише\" України?\nМеморіальна табличка з прізвищем Манкішева, яку встановили за 2500 кілометрів від \"Хонки\", на аеродромі Камінськ-Уральского Свердловської області ще в серпні 2022 року, не дає відповідей.\nВбиральня без золотих унітазів, але з натяком на позолоту\nЗа роки роботи з відвідувачами Межигір'я екскурсовод Юлія Капіца була свідком різних реакцій та психологічних станів.\nОдні плачуть, інші істерично сміються, треті похмуро мовчать або бубонять щось під ніс. Бувало, що люди непритомніють.\nПрозріння трапляється не з усіма, але, каже гід, \"Хонка\" нікого не залишає байдужим. Тут легко оголяють душу, немов на сповіді.\n– Нещодавно була відвідувачка, яка весь час казала: \"Ну як? Як так? Ми йому вірили, а він нас так обдурив!\", – розповідає Капіца. – Навіть зараз деякі люди до кінця не усвідомлюють, якою була влада, суспільство, куди рухалась країна.\nПравильні висновки починають з'являтися. Не так, щоб, знаєте, випирають з діжки, як дріжджі. Але цей процес бродіння вже почався.\nЦерква з куполом, інкрустованим бурштином, на другому поверсі \"Хонки\", недалеко від спальні\nЖадність фраєра згубила\nСеред безлічі міфів, що руйнуються в Межигір'ї, тут легко розвіюється одна з найпоширеніших ілюзій – ніби гроші є запорукою безпеки та вічного життя.\nПереходячи з однієї кімнати \"Хонки\" в іншу, Юлія Капіца зазначає, що після 24 лютого хтось приїжджає в Межигір'я, щоб відпочити. На пару годин повірити, що війни немає.\n– Вони кажуть: \"Ми тут як на іншій планеті!\", – каже Юлія, і саме в цю секунду її телефон розривається сигналом повітряної тривоги.\n\"Увага! – лунає в \"Хонці\". – Повітряна тривога! Пройдіть в найближче укриття!\".\n– Це доказ, що планета все ж таки у всіх одна, – посміхається Юля.\nПортрет Януковича у виконанні російського художника Нікаса Сафронова\nЄвген Руденко, Соня Лукашова, Назарій Мазилюк, УП",

    "maintext": "During the first decades of the twentieth century, Mykhailo Boichuk (1882-1937) was the leader of a school of art unique to Ukraine, identified by Guillaume Apollinaire as the School of Byzantine Revival, now more generally known as Boichukism or Monumentalism. During the Stalinist purges of 1937-38 many of them paid for their art with their lives.\nBoichuk was born in Romanivka, to the south of Ternopil in western Ukraine, when it was part of Galicia in Austro-Hungary. He started his studies in Lviv before moving to Kraków’s Academy of Fine Arts, from which he graduated in 1905. He then travelled in Europe, studying in Vienna and Munich, and went on to Paris in 1907. While he was there he worked with and was influenced by former Nabis including Félix Vallotton and Maurice Denis, as well as Paul Sérusier, and in 1909 he formed a group based on the precepts of Byzantine art. He also visited Italy, where he studied pre-Renaissance paintings of Cimabue and Giotto.\nHe painted this Portrait of a Woman in 1909.\nIn 1910, Boichuk moved back to Lviv, where he worked in the National Museum, primarily on the conservation of icons. This enabled him to develop his vision of monumental art based on the use of traditional techniques such as fresco and tempera, to depict works rooted in traditional religious images, but showing contemporary motifs.\nBoichuk’s sketch of Yaroslavna’s Lament for a mural from the early 1910s shows a fragment of the Old East Slavic epic poem The Tale of Igor’s Campaign popularised in Alexander Borodin’s opera Prince Igor (1887). Princess Yaroslavna is Igor’s second wife, and opens Act 4 by weeping at her separation from her husband, and the defeat of his army by the Polovtsians.\nA Girl Next to A Tree, also from the early 1910s, shows his neo-Byzantine style developing.\nBoichuk’s The Prophet Elijah from 1913 includes ancient textile patterning typical of pre-Renaissance painting in Italy.\nAs an Austrian citizen, he was interned in the Russian Empire during the First World War. After the 1917 October Revolution he returned to Kyiv where he was one of the co-founders of the Ukrainian State Academy of Arts, where he taught fresco and mosaic, and was appointed rector in 1920. In 1925 he co-founded the Association of Revolutionary Art of Ukraine (ARMU), which evolved from the decorative art he made to welcome the Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets to Kharkiv.\nDuring the 1920s, his school included more than two dozen active visual artists, among them Ivan Padalka, Vasyl Sedliar, Oksana Pavlenko and the artist’s wife Sofia Nalepynska-Boichuk. They received many commissions to create monumental works in public buildings throughout Ukraine.\nIn 1937, Boichuk and his school fell from grace during Stalin’s Great Purge. He and others were charged with treason for promoting national identity through a style and form founded on past models of religious art, making them bourgeois nationalists. For that many, including Boichuk, his wife, Sedliar and Padalka were executed, and their works of art destroyed.\nMykhailo Boichuk was shot on 13 July 1937. The remaining records of his frescos and mosaics are mostly old photographs, although a few of his paintings survive in Ukraine.\nReferences\nWikipedia\nAndrey Kurkov and others (2022) Treasures of Ukraine, A Nation’s Cultural Heritage, Thames & Hudson.

    "maintext": "On 6 June, academic and civil society organizations from all over the globe make urgent plea to the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil: Protect fundamental rights by acknowledging encryption’s critical value in protecting privacy and freedom of expression, especially for vulnerable groups.\nThe Federal Supreme Court of Brazil is set to resume the trial for constitutional cases ADPF 403 and ADI 5527. These cases involve the question of whether court orders issued to block the use of an application as a penalty for noncompliance with wiretapping orders are constitutional. The outcome of these cases holds significant implications as it may also address the validity of end-to-end encryption, thereby impacting people’s ability to communicate privately and securely in the country. The repercussions of such a decision would extend beyond Brazil to Latin America and the rest of the world.\nWhen the trial commenced in 2020, Justices Fachin and Weber, who serve as the rapporteurs for these cases, recognized the vital importance of encryption. They acknowledged that encryption is a critical tool in maintaining confidentiality, anonymity, and safeguarding a range of human rights, including privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association. This recognition aligns with the positions taken by various human rights authorities, such as UN organs (see references here, here and here).\nEncryption is a technology relied upon by millions of users worldwide to establish private, secure, and safe connections. Its significance is particularly pronounced for journalists, human rights defenders, activists, and vulnerable groups. Encryption-based communication is essential in protecting sources, enabling these individuals to fulfill their missions, and ensuring the public’s right to be informed and access information. Undermining it would not only harm fundamental rights, but it would make it easier for criminals and other malicious actors to violate the data and communications of millions.\nTherefore, we urgently appeal to the honorable Justices of the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court to consider the following actions:\nDeclare the constitutionality of end-to-end encryption, as advocated by the rapporteurs, who recognize it as a “means to ensure the protection of rights that are essential for public life in a democratic society” (Justice Edson Fachin). Recognize that it is unconstitutional to block a private messaging platform due to the technical impossibility of providing the content of encrypted messages as “the State cannot compel an application to provide a service in a less secure manner under the pretext of using that vulnerability to access data in criminal investigations” (Justice Rosa Weber).\nBy taking these measures, the Federal Supreme Court Justices will play a crucial role in safeguarding the fundamental rights of individuals, ensuring privacy, and upholding democratic principles. We urge the Court to lead the way in protecting encryption as a vital tool for secure and confidential communication.\nSigned*\nIRIS – Institute for Research on Internet and Society\nISOC Brazil – Brazilian Chapter of the Internet Society\nCIPESA- Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa\nInternational Press Institute\nThe Tor Project\nCenter for Democracy & Technology\nFight for the Future\nGlobal Partners Digital\nInternet Society\nInternet Freedom Foundation\nDNS Global Initiatives\nDNS Africa Media and Communications\nMyntex Inc.\nIP.rec – Law and Technology Research Institute of Recife\nKOBOKINGs Limited\nCornerstone Broadcasting Media\nFundación Karisma\nAC-LAC – Alliance for Encryption in Latin America and the Caribbean\nCETYS (UESA – Universidad de San Andrés- Argentina)\nTutanota",

    "maintext": "× Expand Jim Watson/Pool via AP President Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, June 2, 2023.\nOn Sunday, The New York Times trotted out one of its full-page semi-transcripts of a discussion it conducted with a small focus group. These groups don’t carry the weight of the better polls, of course, but often convey enough information to churn nervous tummies, or, if already churning, to inform that churning.\nSunday’s was a real churner. It plumbed the sentiments of 11 “skeptical Biden voters,” and made churningly clear their inability to cite his achievements. Asked, “What are the things President Biden has done or the issues that he has handled that you have been the happiest about?” the first respondent answered, “Man, I’d have to think about this one for a little bit.” Said the next, “I also need a second to think about it.” The third then chimed in, “Student loan forgiveness is something that is going to benefit me and almost every adult I know”—a stomach-soother of an answer except that between the time of the Q&A and the piece’s publication last Sunday, the student loan program had been axed as part of the debt ceiling deal, and was likely to fall prey to the Supreme Court Six even if it hadn’t been. The last respondent did cite a Biden initiative that the Republicans couldn’t derail: “infrastructure spending.”\nMore from Harold Meyerson\nIt should come as no surprise that the first thing the group could come up with was the student loan forgiveness program. Unlike green industrial policy, aid to the semiconductor industry, and the infrastructure spending, the student loan program would have directly and immediately helped individuals. That made it quite unlike the other three, which set in motion the building of projects that will eventually employ construction workers and more eventually employ factory workers and even more eventually bring industries back to the U.S., shortening supply chains and perhaps reducing prices, eventually helping consumers and very eventually slowing the pace of climate change.\nIt’s direct and immediate aid—not projects that will eventually provide aid—that people remember. When Franklin Roosevelt diverted funds from the Public Works Administration, which necessarily took time to gear up to build massive dams (Hoover, Grand Coulee) and bridges (Tri-Borough), and redirected them to the Works Progress Administration, which almost instantly put millions of the unemployed to work paving roads and runways and building parks and schools, he was responding to the immediate needs of people on the verge of starvation—but also creating a project that everyone could see and (unless Republican) appreciate. Likewise Social Security (which also established unemployment insurance), and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a federal minimum wage.\nWhen Biden couldn’t get Congress to enact his Build Back Better bill, that meant that virtually every program that would have provided the kind of direct aid that people remember—paid family leave, the Child Tax Credit, affordable child care, free community college—died on the cutting-room floor. And while what is arguably his greatest achievement—the trillion-dollar expenditure on COVID financial assistance that has given us the fastest economic recovery in the nation’s history and the only one that disproportionately benefited the lowest-income workers—did provide income to millions who needed it, it has never been heralded in the media for its historic achievement, while the inflation to which it contributed is perceived as Biden’s fault, though the costs of oil and housing and corporate profit margins have all soared for reasons that have nothing to do with his presidency.\nStill, this brings us to what really is Biden’s greatest flaw: his inability (as I noted last week) to deliver the kind of speeches that can actually convince Americans of the merits of a cause, or even of his successful programs. The presidency can be a bully pulpit, but only if the president can deliver the kind of secular sermons that sway parishioners, or even just hold their attention. Biden didn’t do that when the Build Back Better bill was becalmed in Congress or when the Republicans took the nation’s creditworthiness hostage. Nor was this failing largely a function of age; those were the kinds of speeches that were beyond the young Joe Biden, too. Though, to be fair, making that kind of speech on behalf of the historic investments he’s pushed through Congress—investments that will help millions, but indirectly and eventually—would tax the most compelling of orators.\nFor which reasons, among many others, Biden is no sure thing in 2024—though be it noted that most of the 11 said they’d vote for him again, given the Republicans.",

Back in 2017, I hypothesized that one day there would come an event – one I referred to as when law enforcement would launch something akin to “simultaneous dawn raids at the major exchanges and the homes and offices of the major ICO promoters, with a variety of agencies in a variety of countries co-ordinating their activities.” It’s hard to tell whether we’re at the beginning of a process that extensive, but if the SEC is going after Coinbase, no one in Coinbase’s business is safe. I called that event “The Zombie Marmot Apocalypse,” said it was massively bearish for crypto and I think it is safe to say that it is now upon us.",

    "maintext": "Recent surges in fentanyl-related overdoses have drawn renewed attention to the drug epidemic in Portland.\nAxios spoke with Oregon Health Authority's John McIlveen, the state's opioid treatment authority, about the strain the crisis has placed on public health infrastructure.\nWhy it matters: Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has fueled a significant increase in overdoses since 2019, per OHA data.\nWhat they're saying: \"The overdose net is getting wider,\" McIlveen said. \"People are overdosing and, at the very minimum, developing severe dependence much faster than they used to.\"\nFentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin, a lot cheaper to buy and manufacture, and 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe big picture: Fentanyl has created a \"perfect storm\" for Oregon's public health infrastructure, McIlveen added, due to its low cost and widespread availability. Overdoses are now trending younger and affecting those who are \"opioid naive\" — first-time users.\nThe explosion in fentanyl use has placed extreme pressure on already overextended, under-resourced public systems like emergency medical technicians, withdrawal assistance programs and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) centers.\n\"The need is outpacing our ability to match that,\" McIlveen said.\nFor example, many of the publicly funded withdrawal management services in Portland, like Hooper Detoxification Stabilization Center, are at capacity. Many Portlanders, most of them homeless, show up for care but are turned away due to lack of beds.\n\"We do need more medication-assisted treatment providers,\" McIlveen said. \"These are systemic issues that come from historical lack of investment.\"\nCentral City Concern, a nonprofit serving people experiencing homelessness in Portland, is currently without nearly a dozen drug and alcohol counselors. Because of that, the organization estimates it's unable to serve over 400 people who would be seeking outpatient treatment.\nWhat's next: McIlveen pointed to some \"bright spots\" in the region's response to the fentanyl crisis.\nIn February, the Grand Ronde Tribe opened its second Great Circle opioid treatment clinic in SE Portland, in addition to its Salem location. Native Americans are one of the most vulnerable populations to overdose deaths.\nA bill in the Oregon Legislature aims to fund drug treatment and behavioral health programs for those incarcerated within the Oregon Department of Corrections. Formerly incarcerated people with histories of addiction have some of the highest rates of overdose nationwide.\nMeanwhile, OHA is building out its Opioid Treatment Program, aimed at delivering counseling and medical services to those experiencing addiction and coordinating care plans with more service providers.\nThe bottom line: \"We can't, and maybe shouldn't, do it all by ourselves,\" McIlveen said. \"We need partners, key stakeholders and people that are doing this work in the communities that are being impacted.\"",

    "maintext": "The smart television is an interesting idea in theory. Rather than having the cable or satellite company control all of the content, a small computer is included in the television itself to host and control various streaming clients and other services. Assuming you have control of the software running on the computer, and assuming it isn’t turned into a glorified targeted advertising machine, this can revolutionize the way televisions are used. It’s even possible to turn a standard television into a smart TV with various Android devices, and it turns out there’s a lot more you can do with these smart TV contraptions as well.\nWith most of these devices, a Linux environment is included running on top of an ARM platform. If that sounds similar to the Raspberry Pi, it turns out that a lot of these old Android TV sets are quite capable of doing almost everything that a Raspberry Pi can do, with the major exception of GPIO. That’s exactly what [Timax] is doing here, but he notes that one of the major hurdles is the vast variety of hardware configurations found on these devices. Essentially you’d have to order one and hope that you can find all the drivers and software to get into a usable Linux environment. But if you get lucky, these devices can be more powerful than a Pi and also be found for a much lower price.\nHe’s using one of these to run RetroPie, which actually turned out to be much easier than installing a more general-purpose Linux distribution and then running various emulation software piecemeal. It will take some configuration tinkering get everything working properly but with [Timax] providing this documentation it should be a lot easier to find compatible hardware and choose working software from the get-go. He also made some improvements on his hardware to improve cooling, but for older emulation this might not be strictly necessary. As he notes in his video, it’s a great way of making use of a piece of electronics which might otherwise be simply thrown out.",

    "maintext": "An independent review board gave NASA’s Psyche mission the green light and its seal of approval following a scathing review in 2022.\nThe Psyche mission, which will head to the asteroid belt, was originally set to launch in October, but it was put on hold due to issues with the spacecraft’s software. The issue was ultimately corrected, but not in enough time to make the launch window. An independent review board was convened to determine what exactly happened.\nThe board’s review revealed workforce issues at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that led to the delay. However, since then, the review board has noted that JPL and the Psyche team have taken the steps — which included adding more experienced members to the team, reorganizing the workforce, and monitoring the project with more comprehensive metrics — to turn the project around and ensure that it can make it to the launch pad, calling the effort “outstanding.”\n“The IRB believes the response to our Psyche project and JPL institution findings and recommendations to be excellent,” retired aerospace executive A. Thomas Young, who led the IRB, said during a press conference on Monday.\n“We believe that Psyche is on a positive course for an October 2023 launch,” he added. “We believe the 2023 launch readiness date is credible, and the overall probability of mission success is high.”\nPsyche is set to explore a metallic core of an asteroid that is 140 miles wide and located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Had it launched as originally scheduled, the spacecraft would have arrived at its destination in early 2026; however, now teams have to find an alternate route to the target, putting its arrival in 2029.\nThis new path also removes the mission’s side project: a small satellite mission called Janus that would have traveled with the Psyche spacecraft to visit two binary asteroid systems.\nThe mission delays have also affected other projects at JPL, namely the center’s Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography and Spectroscopy (or VERITAS) mission.\nNASA says that while no people were pulled off the VERITAS project to work on Psyche, it was affected.\n“What happened with VERITAS is, it didn’t ramp up as expected, and Psyche stayed ramped up longer,” JPL Director Laurie Leshin said during Monday’s press conference. “Psyche has been staffed for most of this year at about 160 workers,” she added. “And some of those may have gone off to work VERITAS if Psyche had launched, but I’m not certain of those numbers.”\nThe Psyche mission aims to help scientists understand how rocky planets form and evolve. To that end, the spacecraft will explore what is thought to be the metallic core of a planetary body also called Psyche.\nAccording to researchers, Psyche might be the partial core of a shattered planetesimal — a small world the size of a city or small country that is the first building block of a planet. Data collected could shed light on the interiors of terrestrial planets like Earth.\nPsyche is scheduled to launch no earlier than October atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.",

    "maintext": "By Dan Moren\nThe new Apple OS features I want right now\nProcessing the keynote is like taking in a big meal: sometimes you have to just sit back and digest. So much information flies by that it can be hard to pick out the details that are important to you, but as I compiled the list of features that didn’t make the keynote cut, I found myself thinking about all the new capabilities that would make the biggest difference to me right now.\nA link to the past\nNot mentioned in the keynote itself, but something that I’ve been looking for ever since Apple started really doubling down on the features it’s adding to Notes: the ability to link notes together.\nCurrently I’ve dabbled with Obsidian as a place to keep information about my novel writing, in part because the ability to interconnect my documents in a wiki-like format is absolutely critical to being able to keep track of what is basically a huge database of information.\nI’m very curious to see how linking notes actually works, and whether it’s as straightforward as, say, Notes’s ability to add tags.\nHard pass\nAs the Six Colors Resident Passkey Enthusiast, I’m interested in any implementation details connected to the next evolution of security. And this year Apple delivered on my top feature request: the ability to share passkeys with others. Even better, it’s backwards compatible to passwords as well.\nI share social media accounts for several podcast with my co-hosts, and while 1Password does make it easy to share credentials with them, not all of them use the app. But with this feature built into Apple’s platforms, it’s a much easier sell. Plus, it keeps the passwords in sync if one of us changes it.\nThis is also a big deal for my household, where most of the passwords to shared accounts like my streaming services are shared with my wife (and occasionally with my parents as well). Being able to easily keep that information synced between the two of us will ensure that she can log into the Apple TV if it suddenly starts asking for a password to be entered again.\nZoom zoom\nThere were more than a few criticisms of the Apple Studio Display’s webcam, but the company’s now addressed what might be the biggest: the previous inability to control the crop of your image. This could lead to some weird looking images, especially when using the Center Stage feature.\nA shortcoming that has now been addressed! Both Apple Studio Display and Continuity Camera now offer controls to pan and zoom the image, letting you present exactly the face you want to show to the world. And users the world over have heaved a sigh of relief.\nA FaceTime for television\nI play in a regular Dungeons & Dragons game via Zoom, and my current setup is to extend my MacBook Air’s display to my Apple TV, and put a Split Screen of Zoom and our game board, in Chrome.\nBut this is annoying, because in order to get both my wife and I on camera, I have to put the Air on a footstool and drag it into place. And then we always end up with our eyes on the TV, and not looking at the camera. I’d actually tried to use my iPhone in Continuity Camera mode at one point, but it turned out that you couldn’t use both that feature and AirPlay at the same time.\nSo the announcement that FaceTime will now come to the Apple TV—and, more to the point, third-party apps like Zoom—will be a big improvement. I’m curious to see whether or not there will be a way to do a Split Screen so I can still put up my Chrome screen, though.\nOughta correct\nMy complaints about typing on my iPhone are well documented, and at long last, it seems Apple has heard the plaintive cries.\nApple promised a bunch of new improvements to typing on the iPhone, including improved predictive typing and better autocorrect. The latter is potentially a big deal, since I’ve found myself often struggling to type a coherent sentence on my iPhone, all too often ending up with words changed into other words I didn’t want, even while other seemingly obvious errors went unfixed.\nThis is one of those changes that, if it indeed pans out, is going to be a huge quality of life improvement. Especially if it means I can enter a web search phrase in Safari without typing ducking periods between each word.\n[Dan Moren is the East Coast Bureau Chief of Six Colors.

    "maintext": "✽\nAs the morning sun ambles over blunted cliffs, whips break the silence below. Their cracks echo off the pristine white houses, standing solemn and dignified.\nOn a crisp March day, the residents of Rimetea, a predominantly ethnically Hungarian village in Romania’s Transylvania region, are roused from winter dormancy to celebrate farsang—a centuries-old carnival tradition rooted in Romania’s Hungarian communities.\nIts purpose? Bury winter and mock the social order. Farsang is a funeral procession where men dress as women, children beg for money, tricksters smear onlookers, and a donkey tows a faux casket.\nEach year, the village of around 600 swells with visitors in the thousands, including children on school trips and tourists from nearby and abroad. They come not only for the carnival but also to visit what is considered by many to be Transylvania’s most picturesque village, known as Rimetea in Romanian or Torockó in Hungarian.\nA prosperous iron-mining center throughout the Middle Ages, Rimetea was built by German settlers and Szeklers, an ethnically Hungarian group. The community always harbored a distinct identity, and when conflagrations burned down most houses on the market square in the late 1800s, the residents elected to rebuild the village uniformly to mimic its white Unitarian church.\nAs building exteriors became austere, however, the community’s multiethnic roots manifested in folk art that was anything but.\n“Torockó is often referred to as a small ethnographic island,” says Ágnes Lassel, a guide working in the local museum. Surrounded by mountains, in a “sea of Romanian culture,” the village has proudly maintained its mostly Hungarian heritage over the centuries.",

    "maintext": "Michelle Chapman\nAssociated Press\nNew York City has filed a lawsuit against Hyundai and Kia, joining a host of other cities beset by a social media fueled wave of car thefts due to a flaw that made some car models highly susceptible to theft.\nViral how-to videos on TikTok and other sites show how to start the cars using only USB cables and a screwdriver. The reason is that some models sold by Hyundai and Kia in the U.S. came without engine immobilizers, a standard feature on most cars since the 1990s that prevent the engine from starting unless the key is present.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed with the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York late Tuesday, alleges that Hyundai Motor America and Kia America Inc. failed to keep up with other automakers by not adopting immobilizer technology that ensured cars could not be started without their keys.\n\"Hyundai’s and Kia’s business decisions to reduce costs, and thereby boost profits, by foregoing common anti-theft technology have resulted in an epidemic of thefts,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe city claims the vehicle thefts are straining the resources of its police department, as well as negatively impacting public safety and emergency services.\nThe New York City police department reports that about 287 Kias were stolen last year, compared with approximately 119 in 2021. Approximately 415 Hyundais were reported stolen in 2022, compared with 232 a year earlier. And the problem has continued, with an estimated 977 Hyundai and Kia vehicles reported stolen in the first four months of this year. There were only 148 such thefts in the same months last year.\nNew York, the nation’s biggest city by population, joins a growing list of cities going after the carmakers following a raft of thefts, including Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee, San Diego and Seattle.\nNew York City, which is seeking a trial by jury, is requesting an order providing for abatement of the public nuisance Hyundai and Kia have created or contributed to, compensation for the economic losses suffered as a result of the nuisance and injunctive relief.\nHyundai says it's committed to ensuring the quality and integrity of its products.\n“A subset of Hyundai vehicles on the road in the U.S. today – primarily “base trim” or entry-level models – are not equipped with push-button ignitions and immobilizing anti-theft devices. It is important to clarify that an engine immobilizer is an anti-theft device and these vehicles are fully compliant with federal anti-theft requirements,” the automaker said in a written statement.\nHyundai made engine immobilizers standard on all of its vehicles made from November 2021 onward. The company also said that it's speaking with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on the actions it is taking to assist its customers.\nKia did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.\nLast month Hyundai and Kia reached a settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit prompted by a surge in vehicle thefts.\nThe settlement could be valued at $200 million and covers about 9 million 2011-2022 model year Hyundai and Kia vehicles in the U.S., the companies said at the time.\nThe settlement will provide cash compensation to customers who suffered theft-related losses or damage not covered by insurance – as well as reimbursement for insurance deductibles, increased insurance premiums and other losses, Kia and Hyundai said.\nA software upgrade will also be provided to eligible owners. For customers with vehicles that cannot accommodate the software upgrade, the agreement will provide a reimbursement of up to $300 for anti-theft devices.\nKia and Hyundai have also given impacted customers tens of thousands of free steering wheel locks through local law enforcement and direct shipments, the companies said.\nThat proposed settlement is expected to be reviewed in court for preliminary approval in July.",

    "maintext": "By Nadia Lopez | Bloomberg\nIt took less than 90 days for the oil and gas lobby to blow up one of Gavin Newsom’s major achievements.\nThe California governor signed a bill to great fanfare in September to block new oil and gas wells within 3,200 feet of homes, schools and hospitals, cementing an effort that took decades for environmentalists to push through against business and union interests.\nBut that’s when the California Independent Petroleum Association went to work. Representing 300 oil and gas producers, the organization quickly raised $21 million to recruit people to collect signatures — at shopping malls, farmers’ markets and grocery stores — and get enough support to put the issue to voters.\nThe petitioners obtained 687,058 valid names, surpassing the threshold needed to put Senate Bill 1137 to a referendum in 2024 and placing Newsom’s new law on hold. The price tag for the industry: about $20 per signature.\nNow that effort is sparking backlash, not only from Newsom, a Democrat who slammed “greedy” oil companies, but from lawmakers in Sacramento. Isaac Bryan, a recently elected member of the California Assembly, is trying to make it harder for groups to use referendums to repeal laws that they dislike.\nBryan this year introduced Assembly Bill 421 to end the practice of paying petitioners per signature — referred within political circles as “bounty hunting.” His bill would require political campaigns to obtain 5% of all signatures from unpaid volunteers or via alternative means, such as through workers paid a hourly wage or as independent contractors.\nThe bill is now in the Senate after clearing a hurdle in the Assembly last week. Lawmakers have until the end of August to make changes and pass the bill before it would be sent to the governor for final approval. Democrats have a supermajority in both chambers.\n“We want to move away from the pay per-signature model and move to something that doesn’t create incentives to lie to people to get signatures,” said Bryan, a Democrat who represents an area of Los Angeles. Referendums have “become a tool for concentrated, well-funded interests to undo legislation.”\nThe debate reflects broader political tension in California, where for decades voters have used ballot measures to circumvent lawmakers and directly shape policy around everything from taxes to homelessness and education.\nIn recent years the process has become significantly about money. In last year’s election, funders contributed about $750 million to either support or oppose seven measures in California — roughly double the spending on ballot initiatives in all other states combined. That included two measures rejected by voters to legalize sports betting, which were the most expensive initiatives in history at more than $500 million.\n“The amount of money spent in California is off the charts compared to other states,” said John Matsusaka, a professor of business economics at the University of Southern California. “And we should care about the money, but ultimately, it’s the voters who decide.”\nThe bill’s supporters say the root of the problem is the influence of powerful interest groups who can buy their way onto the ballot. California is home to more billionaires than any other state and many big companies, creating outsized wealth that can be wielded to influence how the world’s fifth-biggest economy functions.\nBut opponents argue referendums are a vital check on the power of the government and warn that changing the current pay model — even in a minor way — could substantially increase campaign spending.\nMichael Arno, founder of Arno Political Consultants, a firm with four decades of experience in petitioning services, said an hourly pay model could result in costs that are two to three times higher.\nA per-signature rate is more efficient because it incentivizes petitioners to collect only valid signatures and reduces duplicate or invalid ones, Arno said. “I can pay someone for a full eight-hour day and I can fire them the next day, but I just lost a lot of money,” he said. “Whereas on a per-signature basis, I’m only paying for what that person collects.”\nRead More: Chipotle CEO Says Doing Business in California Is Getting Harder\nBryan’s bill focuses on state referendums, which are votes to overturn existing laws.\nMichael Bloomberg, the majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, helped fund the campaign in California to uphold the law banning the sale of flavored tobacco products last year.\nThere are also ballot initiatives to create or change laws, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc.’s successful $200 million bid to exempt ride-hailing apps from a California labor law in 2020. And there are recall votes to remove elected officials from office, such as the failed attempt to oust Newsom in 2021.\nEnvironmentalists who support Bryan’s bill say reform is needed due to the deceptive tactics used by campaigns to gather support. They advocated for the oil-drilling law to protect an estimated 3 million Californians, largely in low-income communities, who live near the wells and are exposed to harmful pollution.\n“The cost of doing business for the oil industry is being paid with the health and well-being of people and the climate,” said Cesar Aguirre, an environmental justice advocate.\nRock Zierman, chief executive officer of the oil and gas group CIPA, said it’s wrong for legislators to significantly reform a process that’s constitutionally protected. Donors to the association’s Stop the Energy Shutdown referendum bid included Sentinel Peak Resources California and Signal Hill Petroleum Inc.\nRelated Articles California Politics | Will California voters get to vote on stricter punishments for fentanyl dealers?\nWill California voters get to vote on stricter punishments for fentanyl dealers?

    "maintext": "The massive Nova Kakhovka Dam was blown up Tuesday morning, with Kiev and Moscow trading blame for the attack\nThe Nova Kakhovka Dam, located in southern Ukraine along the Dnipro River, was destroyed on Tuesday. While Kiev and Moscow are accusing each other of the attack, Russia will suffer more consequences of the dam’s destruction.\nThe dam was built by the USSR during the 1950s and, for over a year, has sat on the frontlines of the war in Ukraine. It is nearly 100 feet tall and over 10,000 feet wide. The dam was constructed as a hydroelectric power plant and created the Kakhovka Reservoir, which is over 2,000 sq km. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and the Crimean Peninsula receive water from the reservoir.\nAn explosion reportedly ripped through the dam on Tuesday morning, causing flooding to begin downstream. It is unclear if the attack was intentional. The BBC noted the dam had been damaged within the last week.\nThe most immediate impact of the dam’s destruction is flooding surrounding areas, which is expected to displace at least 16,000 people. A Ukrainian official said eight towns have already been partially or completely flooded. The flooding is expected to be worse in areas controlled by Russia.\nThe region will also suffer environmental damage from the flooding and tonnes of industrial lubricant used in the hydroelectric power plant.\nAnother concern is the ZNPP, which is controlled by Russian forces. The Kakhovka Reservoir provided cooling water to the massive power plant. The IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog group, said it is “closely monitoring the situation,” but there is “no immediate nuclear safety risk.”\nKiev immediately blamed Moscow for the attack, calling it a “terrorist attack and war crime.” Ukraine’s Defense Ministry suggested Russia destroyed the dam as a tactical defense of the region.\nUkrainian President Zelensky claimed it was impossible for Ukrainians to have carried out the dam’s destruction. \"Russia has been controlling the dam and the entire Kakhovka HPP for more than a year. It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling.\" He continued, \"It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up.\"\nHowever, last year, Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Andriy Kovalchuk told the Washington Post he considered attacking the dam during Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year. \"Kovalchuk considered flooding the river.\" The Post reported. \"The Ukrainians, he said, even conducted a test strike with a HIMARS launcher on one of the floodgates at the Nova Kakhovka dam, making three holes in the metal to see if the Dnieper’s water could be raised enough to stymie Russian crossings but not flood nearby villages. The test was a success, Kovalchuk said.\"\nKremlin Spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Ukrainian forces were behind the destruction of the dam. “The president receives reports through the Defense Ministry and other services on what is happening around the Kakhovka HPP. Here we can already say unequivocally that this is deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,” he said.\nThe attack on the dam will impact a core Russian concern in Ukraine. Through the 250-mile-long Northern Crimean Canal, the Kakhovka Reservoir feeds water to the peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin regularly issued demands to Kiev that irrigation systems supplying water to Crimea remain open.\nPeskov said part of Kiev’s motivation for the attack was depriving Crimea of water. \"The water level in the reservoir is dropping, hence, the water supply to the [North Crimean] canal is drastically reduced,” the spokesman said, adding, “Apparently, this sabotage is also due to the fact that, having launched large-scale offensive operations two days ago, the Ukrainian armed forces have been unable to achieve their aims. Their operations are stalled.”\nKyle Anzalone is the opinion editor of Antiwar.com, news editor of the Libertarian Institute, and co-host of Conflicts of Interest.",

    "title_rss": "NULL",
    "maintext": "Mike Pence is officially running for president. Why?\nWell, because he wants to be president—that much has been clear since he accepted an invitation to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2016 despite his obvious incompatibility with Trump as a matter of both personal comportment and ideology. Among other things, Pence was a “traditional family values” guy and national security “hawk” vis-à-vis figures like Vladimir Putin; joining the Trump campaign was pretty obviously a case of careerism over principle. And when you’re ambitious, and you’re the vice president, the next job you’re probably looking for is the big one!\nAdvertisement\nBut why does Pence think he has a chance of becoming president? This was a good question even before the events of Jan. 6, 2021. His record is extremely conservative even by Republican standards; he criticized George H.W. Bush for signing civil rights legislation and raising taxes and, in 2003, warned that a Medicare prescription drug benefit supported by the younger Bush would potentially “usher in the beginning of socialized medicine in America.” His most high-profile act as governor of Indiana was signing a bill intended to allow businesses to refuse service to gay customers.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThis is why Trump selected him as a VP candidate—to give the 2016 Republican ticket credibility among the kinds of free-market evangelicals once thought of as the GOP “base.” But the idea of someone as fiscally and socially conservative as Pence winning a national election in 2024, or really at any point in modern U.S. history, is far-fetched, especially when you consider that conservative figures like George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan were at least considered personally charming by many middle-of-the-road voters. (Pence is, to my knowledge, not considered charming by any statistically significant group of Americans. He speaks in a plodding cadence, and his signature expression—you’d be forgiven for wondering whether it’s his only expression—is a kind of squinting grimace that, to paraphrase the writer Moira Donegan, seems confused about whether it’s supposed to be conveying swaggering alpha aggressiveness or restrained moral piety.)\nAdvertisement\nThose are just the reasons to believe Pence wouldn’t win a general election. In the Republican primary, he’s now contending with a huge number of voters who believe he betrayed the party by refusing to help overturn 2020. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has more money than Pence, is polling way ahead of him, and has been targeting the religious and social conservatives Pence would need to form a winning coalition. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is running on a return-to-traditional-Republican-values theme, which is expected to be the theme of Pence’s campaign as well, without any of Pence’s Trump-related baggage.\nIf you really had to make a case that there was a Mike Pence path to victory—let’s say someone put a gun to your head, or you were his campaign manager—it would probably have to unfold in the following way:\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n• Pence spends the next seven months in Iowa convincing the portion of the state’s evangelical voters who haven’t written him off because of 2020 that he’s the most authentic representative of their values.\n• DeSantis drops out before voting starts to save face after his much-hyped, expensive campaign fails to gain any ground against Trump.\n• Pence finishes in what pundits call “a strong second place” in Iowa, establishing media momentum and perhaps the support of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers’ donor network that he’s worked with in the past (and which says it will be endorsing a non-Trump candidate).\n• Trump is indicted for so many different alleged crimes that he’s logistically unable to campaign (and falls well behind Joe Biden in head-to-head general election polling), leaving Pence as the Republican front-runner and, eventually, nominee.\n• Biden suffers some sort of health problem that calls his fitness to serve into serious question, but doesn’t drop out of the race.\n• Pence appeals to swing voters by touting his Jan. 6 stand on behalf of democracy and wins the lowest-turnout presidential election ever.\nCould that happen? Yes. Will it? No. But what has Mike Pence ever demonstrated as a public figure if not an immense capacity for self-delusion?",

Volunteer groups say that they've had to deal with unresponsive staff, threats from security guards, and an ever-rotating group of private contractors and City supervisors who are overseeing the site, just to distribute items like food and clothing.\n\"My staff has been harassed by the Office of Emergency Management while trying to do clothing distribution, but when people don’t have shoes or socks, it's not acceptable,\" State Assemblymember Harvey Epstein told Hell Gate.\nEpstein, whose district office is across the street from St. Brigid, coordinated with City Hall to take a tour of the center last month, but was barred by security, and physically restrained from entering. Eventually, Epstein was able to enter the center last Friday.\n\"We have been asking for a point of contact for over a week, and there's just no person in charge at all,\" Epstein added. \"We've been asking for there to be an intergovernmental person on site to help coordinate this type of community support, and that just hasn't happened.\"\nDuring our visit, we watched as an employee from Verizon approached the staff of MedRite, an urgent care company now contracted to run the respite center, offering to connect the center with free Wi-Fi so asylum seekers could have internet access—crucial for looking for work, finding housing, and continuing or beginning the asylum application process. The group NYC Mesh has also been trying to set up Wi-Fi at the building. But both Verizon and NYC Mesh were turned away.\n\"We have this miracle that literally delivers the world of information to you through the air, and it would be incredibly easy for us to be able to expand that network to St. Brigid,\" said Rob, a volunteer with NYC Mesh, who asked we withhold his last name because of his current employment. \"If only we could get access to the building, we could make life a lot easier for people in a tough situation.\"\nNYC Mesh has a hub site for its network directly across the street from St. Brigid. To bring the internet into the respite center would only require NYC Mesh volunteers to enter the site, put a receiver on the roof of the building, and run a cable down to a router in the basement. So far, their efforts in getting permission, or even finding the right person to speak with, have been fruitless.\n\"We're happy to help, but we can't even figure out who's in charge,\" Rob said.\nThe respite centers, rolled out hastily by the Adams administration last month, are meant to help relieve the City's crowded shelter system. The center at St. Brigid School, which has been vacant since its closure in 2019, is part of an effort by the City to identify unused spaces, especially those connected with faith-based groups, to provide shelter to migrants.\nBecause the centers are run by the Office of Emergency Management, and not the City's Department of Homeless Services, they aren't required to provide much in the way of services or infrastructure. On the day we visited, we were told over a hundred migrants were being housed on cots in the basement of St. Brigid, and more people were in other rooms throughout the building, which has no showers. During the day, staff members at the site accompany migrants to a community pool on East 10th street, where they're allowed to bathe.\nMo, a migrant from Turkey, on Seventh Street in the East Village. (Hell Gate)\nCity Hall has referred to the respite centers as a \"waiting room\" for migrants before they're placed in more permanent housing. But several people Hell Gate spoke with on Tuesday had been there for over a week.\nMo, a migrant from Turkey who only gave his first name, told Hell Gate the respite center wasn't a \"bad place,\" and that food was consistently available and the staff was friendly and helpful to migrants.\n\"I've been translating for a lot of the guys,\" said Mo, who speaks several languages after living in Germany and Spain for several years. \"And everybody wants to keep me around to keep helping people out here.\"\nHe said he considered himself to have a \"luxury hotel\" situation in the center because he was on the third floor, and only sharing a room with eight other men. In the school's basement, the cots were stacked almost right on top of one another. Mo described how City officials keep pitching migrants on taking buses up to Albany, but \"no one wants to leave.\"\n\"They're just letting people know it's an option if they want to go,\" he said.\nAt the corner of Tompkins Square Park, Hell Gate spoke with a group of migrants from Mauritania. Through Google Translate, they said they had crossed into the United States in California, and came to New York a few days ago. They had no clothing or belongings, but were appreciative that the respite center was clean and safe. But they wished that the center had Wi-Fi, so they could begin the online application process for a work permit.\nCity Hall did not respond to a request for comment.\nNew York City's efforts to house and feed migrants has been remarkable—no other city in the United States has devoted as many resources to marshaling hotels, expanding shelters, and creating navigation centers. The mayor, in turn, has called on the federal government to step up and provide more funding. But the City has long struggled to integrate community and mutual aid groups into the response to the arrival of migrants, even as groups have stepped up to offer support. Last summer, City Hall clashed with community and mutual aid groups that were trying to assist migrants at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. In Brooklyn, City Hall failed to engage community residents before it began quietly placing migrants in school gyms.\nOn Tuesday morning, volunteers put out collapsible tables in front of the school, as security guards helped migrants form a line to be able to receive items like shoes, bags, and phone chargers. But to even be allowed to distribute clothing on the sidewalk took careful negotiation with MedRite, according to volunteers.\n\"It's understandably challenging with a group of City and state agencies, and their contractors, trying to sort out a difficult situation that's been thrust upon them,\" said Laura Sewell, the executive director of the East Village Community Coalition, who has been helping with clothing distribution. \"But our community has been a help-oriented community since the 1800s, so when something like this happens in our neighborhood, we're going to try to find a way to help without ruffling too many feathers.\"\nSewell, who is already planning on being part of another clothing distribution on Thursday, believes the City has an opportunity to tap into groups already doing the exact kind of work that migrants would benefit from.\n\"With each site, just setting up a pipeline of communication, pointing out who we talk to each day, would be the move,\" Sewell said. \"The people are here now and they need help, and we're here to give it.\"",

Photo courtesy of Amtrak\nAnother landslide in the San Clemente area forced a renewed halt in passenger rail service through southern Orange County on Monday.\nThe tracks used by Metrolink and Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains were closed around 8 a.m. between San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano as crews inspected what appeared to be another significant movement of the hillside overlooking the tracks, just below the Casa Romantica Cultural Center and Gardens.\nSome of the mud and rocks wound up abutting the train tracks.\nALERT: As of 11:00am PT, All Train services between Oceanside (OSD) and Irvine (IRV) are currently stopped. Alternate transportation is being provided. Updated information to come. #SurflinerAlert — Pacific Surfliner (@PacSurfliners) June 5, 2023\n“The tracks will reopen once the debris has been cleared and it is determined safe to operate trains through the area,” Amtrak said in a statement.\nThe railroad said it was scheduling buses to assist passengers Monday, and a bus bridge would be in effect between Oceanside and Irvine on Tuesday.\nMetrolink said it would provide stranded passengers with $50 Uber vouchers to reach their final destinations.\nThe tracks had been closed for about a month starting in late April due to the unstable hillside, but had reopened on May 27.\nThere was no immediate estimate of how long the line would be closed after this latest landslide.\nCity News Service contributed to this article.",

    "maintext": "Prohibition of so-called assault weapons and their accessories is consistent with the nation’s tradition of regulating “exceptionally dangerous arms,” a federal judge has ruled.\nU.S. District Judge Robert Bryan, a Ronald Reagan appointee, denied a motion for preliminary injunction filed by gun-rights advocates against Washington state’s assault weapon ban on Tuesday. Judge Bryan said AR-15s and similar firearms have caused “unprecedented social concerns” and are used “disproportionately in mass shootings, police killings, and gang activity.” Thus, they can be regulated by states in the same way previous dangerous weapons were regulated in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n“Semiautomatic assault weapons represent a significant technological change – they allow a shooter to fire as fast as they can pull the trigger, unlike previous guns,” Judge Bryan wrote in his order. “Regulation of assault weapons and their dangerous accessories, as HB 1240 regulates, is arguably consistent with our Nation’s history and tradition of exceptionally dangerous arms regulation.”\nThe ruling is a major setback for gun-rights advocates who are currently fighting “assault weapons” bans in courts across the country.\nJudge Bryan’s analysis will likely prove controversial among gun-rights supporters but could be celebrated by gun-control advocates for its expansive view of what constitutes historical analogues for modern gun bans. His reasoning is nearly identical to that used by a federal judge in Delaware who denied an injunction request against the state’s semi-auto rifle ban, and by a federal judge in Oregon in favor of the state’s voter-initiated ban on “large-capacity” magazines, suggesting that it could become the dominant legal argument in favor of modern hardware bans.\nBryan cited historical regulations on trap guns, bowie knives, clubs, slungshots, and multi-shot revolvers as historical examples of “weapons that, after being invented, their use proliferated, the weapons began to be used for interpersonal violence, and then States regulated the weapons.”\nHe noted that even though the historical laws almost uniformly did not ban possession of the weapons in question, only public carry, the laws were nevertheless relevantly similar because “they impose ‘comparable burdens’ on the right of armed self-defense.”\nHe also cited the regulation of automatic weapons under the 1934 National Firearms Act and Congress’s 1994 federal assault weapon ban as evidence of the government’s authority to ban modern firearms.\n“Even these late events are part of assault weapon regulation in the Nation’s history,” Judge Bryan wrote.\nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D.), the chief proponent of the state’s ban, celebrated the decision.\n“We remain undefeated against the gun lobby in court,” Ferguson said in a press release. “This common-sense gun reform will save lives by restricting access to the preferred weapon of mass shooters.”\nThe Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC), one of the gun rights organizations challenging the ban, said the group was dissappointed by the outcome of the injunction request.\n“We’re disappointed with the Court’s ruling but remain undeterred in our fight for and defense of the People’s natural right to self-defense,” Cody Wisniewski, the group’s Senior Attorney for Constitutional Litigation, told The Reload.\nThe group did not comment on whether it planned to appeal the decision.\nUPDATE 5:04 PM Eastern 6-6-2023: This piece has been updated with comment from the Firearms Policy Coalition.",

    "maintext": "A driverless Chevrolet Bolt operated by GM’s Cruise robotaxi company was spotted stuck in the middle of an intersection that was under construction in San Francisco. But while this is far from the first time a Cruise autonomous taxi stopped in the middle of the road blocking traffic, it’s Elon Musk’s involvement that makes things a bit more interesting this time around.\nThe video embedded below was posted on Twitter a couple of days ago by the user Tesla Owners Silicon Valley and was later retweeted by @stevenmarkryan, who said that “Generalized autonomy (see Tesla) is 100x harder than the brittle ‘self-driving’ tech we see here.”\nThe post goes on to describe how Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving system “will scale widely because it is intelligent,” interpreting what it “sees” in real-time and acting accordingly. Just one minute later, Elon Musk jumped on the reply wagon and said: “Yeah, extremely brittle to local conditions & doesn’t scale.”\nThis isn’t the first time the outspoken CEO replied to random Twitter posts, but it’s the first time we can think of that he got involved with a video showing a stuck Cruise Chevy Bolt EV.\nYesterday, in another Twitter reply, Musk said that Tesla is happy to license its so-called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance systems to other automakers, in addition to opening up the Supercharger network and applying an open-source mentality for its technology patents.\nAs for GM’s Cruise robotaxi service, this isn’t the first time it got in trouble on the streets of San Francisco, where it operates driverless vehicles. In March, two Bolts got tangled up in downed wires and caution tape after a storm hit the city, and a few days later, another vehicle rear-ended a municipal bus.\nLast year, a Cruise self-driving vehicle was involved in an accident with a Toyota Prius that injured people in both cars, and in another instance, a driverless Chevy was stopped by the police because it was driving without its lights on during the evening, but there was nobody inside, which must have been fun.\nAs always, we’d like to know what you think about this, so scroll down to the comments section below to give us your thoughts.",

    "maintext": "June 3, 2023\nA report published on Friday by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica claims that the Mossad and Italian intelligence people who were on the boat that capsized earlier this week at Lake Maggiore in northern Italy, were not vacationing there, but actually working together to prevent Iran from obtaining advanced weapons.\nThe incident occurred last Sunday. Unexpected bad weather caused a boat sailing on Lake Maggiore to capsize. Four out of the 23 passengers drowned, including retired Mossad agent Erez Shimoni, in his fifties. The three others that drowned were two Italian intelligence officers and the Russian wife of the boat captain. The other passengers managed to swim to the shores and save themselves.\nThe official Italian version said that the boat capsized because of an unexpected, violent storm while the Israelis and the Italians were celebrating a passenger's birthday. Other reports in Italy noted that the boat was overloaded, carrying 23 people instead of the 15 authorized. The boat's skipper, Carlo Carminati, is currently being investigated by Italian police because of the number of passengers on board.\nThe Italian authorities said the incident was not the result of any terror attack. That being said, after the incident, several reports were published in Italy and elsewhere over the true nature of the trip. La Repubblica reported that ten Israeli Mossad or ex-Mossad agents who survived the incident were flown back to Israel very rapidly, on a private Mossad airplane. It also suggested that the Israeli and Italian agents were celebrating after an operation.\nIsraeli censorship initially banned the publication of Shimoni’s name, removing the gag only after several foreign news outlets published the information. Shimoni had retired, but according to the New York Times, he continued to serve from time to time, and had arrived with Israeli colleagues to Italy as part of cooperative relations between the two spy organizations. Shimoni was laid to rest in the southern city of Ashkelon. Many Mossad employees attended the funeral wearing surgical masks, so as not to have their faces exposed.\n\"Because of his service for the Mossad, little can be told about him. The Mossad lost a dear friend, a loyal and professional worker who dedicated his life to the security of the State of Israel, for several years and also after retiring. The Mossad shares the grief of the family, which it will continue to accompany and embrace,\" said a statement published by the Israeli spy agency.",

    "maintext": "Reading Time: 38 minutes\nArvid Kahl 0:00\nHello everyone and welcome to The Bootstrapped Founder. Today, I’m talking to Joe Masilotti, the founder of RailsDevs, a reverse job platform for Ruby on Rails developers. We talk about monetizing an open source project, building in public and marketing yourself and your business both to employers and developers. Here’s Joe.\nWhat I love about your founder journey, your journey as an entrepreneur is that it starts with a spreadsheet, that is really cool. So can you take me back to the day when you first created this magical document and what you were doing at the time and why that inconspicuous spreadsheet ended up jumpstarting this amazing indie business of yours?\nJoe Masilotti 0:40\nYeah, I’d love to. So I had been a Rails consultant for going on three years now. Actually hit my three year anniversary in just a month and have been doing Rails for like over a decade and got to the point where like, I was pretty solid with my freelance business. And I had too many leads, like great problem to have and too many people that wanted to work with me and couldn’t offer them anyone to like, anywhere to get help. There wasn’t really this place where I could say, oh, yeah, here’s, you know, some folks who are looking for freelance work. So I kind of just started asking my network almost entirely on Twitter. Do you do Rails freelancing? If so, when are you available? And just kind of collected those names onto a list with their email addresses. And the next person that reached out to me, I was like, hey, sorry, you know, too busy right now. But if anyone on this list looks good, I’ll happily introduce you to them. And within like, two weeks, someone had a new freelance gig. Within a month, someone had a full time gig. It was like, all immediately almost, it was seeing success and people getting hired. And not just for freelance stuff, but for full time gigs as well. And I was like, okay, this little Google spreadsheet that I’m sharing around, like, there’s something here that I think there might be a business here. And I want to say like three or four weeks after that first entry to that spreadsheet, I started writing the first line of what will eventually become RailsDevs.\nArvid Kahl 2:10\nThat’s so cool. You have the magic touch or you just know the right people. That’s probably what it is.\nJoe Masilotti 2:15\nIt was a good combo, a good combo of the two because the folks that are recommending where he’s been hired twice through it already, Jared White, who was local to Portland with me, creator of Bridgetown is working with two different clients that found him both through RailsDevs. So you know, he’s like my big success story for the freelance side of things. And he was the first one and one of the more recent ones to get hired through it. So it’s like, knowing all those folks that are getting involved and spreading the word on Twitter has been awesome.\nArvid Kahl 2:45\nYeah, I bet it does. It’s nothing better than having actual, like an impact in somebody else’s life twice. This is quite intense. One thing that I wonder always when I see people building marketplaces, particularly bootstrapping marketplaces is like, do you ever say this? Like, do you like to kind of punish yourself? Because I always feel like marketplaces super hard, you know, to just bootstrap both sides at the same time. You have clients, you have customers, you kind of need to connect them. Was that intentional from the start? Like, did you know this has to be a marketplace? And how did you go about this?\nJoe Masilotti 3:20\nYeah, so this is my third marketplace. And the first one was what my full time job was before I went freelance. We were connecting folks who were looking for a specific type of beer to bars that were selling that type of beer. And obviously a very, very clear marketplace. You can’t have one without the other. My second foray into that was a board game event matching system. So like you find your local area, what are the board games that are happening now? Needed buy in from the businesses, the places that were hosting along with the players that were going. It just started to get legs and then COVID hit so like that kind of totally fell off. But I pretty much every time I leave one of these marketplaces, I’m like, I’m never doing a marketplace again. Like, every time I leave, I’m like B2B all the way. Maybe even B2C, but like, I am not doing a marketplace again. And then relatives came about and I was like, no, this isn’t a marketplace. This is just a list of developers and businesses will find them. It’s not a marketplace. It’s just businesses getting hired on one side, you know and hiring on the other. It’s not, etc, etc, until I finally realized I’m, you know, I’m building a marketplace. But I think that the difference this time for me was that once I recognized that I was actually building you know, a marketplace here, I leaned in entirely to one side of that business. So if you popped her on the website, if you’ve seen anything on Twitter, I very rarely talk to the business side of things. I’m always talking about the developer experience, getting hired, how it’s easier to find a new contract jobs, how juniors can get their first role. I’m leaning 100% into the developer side of the marketplace. And this has really helped A. bootstrap it. Like it pretty much solved the chicken or the egg problem, like the cold start problem. But it also really helps me hone my marketing and my branding for the business. Very rarely will you hear me talking about, oh, this business hired three devs, you know, yeah, I’ll post some screenshots of revenue. Sure, because it’s exciting. But everything that I build and I make is all about these developers just having a better hiring experience, the initial problem I’m trying to solve. And I think that that’s really helped in A, you know, like I said, the branding. But B. really figured out that marketplace problem where I’m flooding one side of the marketplace, where if you’re a business trying to hire a Rails developer, it’s silly to not be on my platform. It’s like it’s the biggest already in just a year, it’s the biggest amount of developers that are looking for Rails jobs, specifically available online. Like why would you not use it? And I think that that’s really helped to get like a good kickstart for it.\nArvid Kahl 4:34\nDid you ever consider doing the opposite of that, like focusing almost exclusively on the business side on the clients or people looking for developers?\nJoe Masilotti 6:13\nYeah, so I considered it briefly. But I think that it was never really a starter for me because I had the spreadsheet to begin with. Like I had kind of the core of the business without any product, just the business. To begin with, why would I go and try and change that. And the more I thought about it, I was like, if I did it again, would I have leaned into the business side and maybe I’d have more businesses using it. And I say to myself, I don’t think so because you can have this marketplace with 1000 developers and one business and still change someone’s life. You can still change one or two or three people’s lives. If you have 100 hiring businesses and two developers, you’re not doing anything. You’re not solving a problem anymore because those businesses aren’t gonna find who they want in just two developers or three developers. So flooding one side of it and having the opportunity for the businesses to have the kind of the pick of the litter, but still giving the developers that opportunity to sell themselves how they want to be sold and market themselves, how they want to be marketed, is just in my mind a way better way to go about it.\nArvid Kahl 7:22\nYeah, definitely. It kind of speaks to the indie hacker spirit, you know.\nJoe Masilotti 7:26\nYeah, yeah\nArvid Kahl 7:26\nLike you’re on the side of the little guy. You’re trying to make this an experience for the individual person trying to build something in their lives because most people freelancing either do it because they want to be doing some something else, right? Either built their own business or just get their family through this weird pandemic, all these things or you know, they wanna build an agency. Like, there’s always some other goal beyond freelancing for at least for most people. So it’s nice to see you enabling those people. Whereas companies, you know, they have their own goals. And they might be rather repetitive, rather boring in many ways. It’s nice to see you leaning towards that side. How do you monetize this? Or rather have you thought of multiple different angles of monetizing and then chosen one in particular?\nJoe Masilotti 8:12\nSo I went through a huge exercise. I think that the Notion doc is actually still public or the GitHub discussion. We could link to it, if I can dig it up, where I decided that, okay, there are businesses now that want to hire through this platform. And there, I think it was, like 150 developers already, like, you know, a month or two and what’s the way to monetize this? So it’s sustainable for like I can continue to work on it and continue to make it better and actually become a real thing. And my three options for monetization were ads and sponsorships, which felt really good because I didn’t have to worry about hounding any businesses. It’d be free for businesses and but then I kind of realized that I’m always going to be chasing that next ad or that next business and I really didn’t want to be in the business of ads to be like, it just wasn’t appealing to me. The second was to monetize the developers. So this would be something where developers could pay $1 or $10 or $100 to boost their profile to the top of the results or maybe put a yellow border around it, you know, all the fancy. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yellow background, maybe the blue background for $150. And it just felt so wrong, that I’m monetizing the folks who need the help, who need the help getting hired. And what I ended up deciding on was option three, essentially asking the people who have the money to pay for me to provide the service. These businesses are hiring developers for 100, 150, 200K, right? Like that’s a ton of revenue being or money being passed around. If I took a just the tiny bit off the top of that, not the developers getting less, but I’m just getting a share of it. All of a sudden, I’m solving a real problem. I’m making enough money. This could become a real thing for me maybe even full time I’m in the future. And that developer has their life changed by opportunity that they would not have gotten elsewhere. To me, it’s a win win win. And as you always say, I’m gonna butcher this quote, but what is it? A business is an idea that makes someone money. Rephrase for me.\nArvid Kahl 10:16\nThat’s pretty true.\nJoe Masilotti 10:17\nYeah\nArvid Kahl 10:18\nThat’s right. Yeah, it’s a project, right? It’s something that could have been a hobby. But someone’s making money of it. So it’s a business. It’s kind of what it is. That is awesome. I love this. So it’s this kind of a subscription model where people pay like a fixed fee? Is that what it is for you?\nJoe Masilotti 10:31\nYeah, it’s a subscription model and the hiring fee. So businesses have to pay $300 a month to be part of the platform. And this is where you get full access to the developer database, where you’re able to message folks on the platform, you get full access to the website, no restrictions. And that is a really good way for me to vet these businesses. $300 is a lot of money to just like, put your credit card down and try something you know. So every single person that comes through, I’m emailing with them. Sometimes I hop on the phone with them. I’m figuring out what they’re looking for. Are we the right fit? Before they even can pay, I’m vetting these folks. And I’m not vetting them on terms of like is their business a quality business? Because I’m not in the position to do that. But I’m vetting them in terms of if we’re right fit for each other. Once they pay that 300 bucks a month, they have access for as long as that subscription is active to like I said, message any developer on the site. They have access to all the fancy searching tools and filtering algorithms and stuff that has been built into the app over the past year. And then if they hire someone, they have to pay a 10% hiring fee off from their salary. So if they hire a freelancer, that’s cool, no extra fees. But if they hire a full time developer, let’s say for 100k, they’re required to pay RailsDevs $10,000. And that’s significant. That’s not only like significant in terms of each hire, substantially improves, you know, my outlook and my runway for this. But it’s also way less than what a traditional recruiter would pay or would charge. Recruiters in the tech space charge 20, 30, 40% sometimes, so I kind of fit that middle ground where it’s great for that business that is willing to get their hands dirty and put in the little work, a little more work to save a ton of money, but doesn’t want to do it all through like, you know, LinkedIn cold messaging, so to speak.\nArvid Kahl 12:25\nYeah, right. Yeah, it sounds like particularly like with 300 bucks a month for a company that hires a lot of developers. You know, that’s like a rounding error, comparatively, you know, to the salaries and then saving almost 20% on the hiring fee too. That is very lucrative, sounds awesome. So you’re doing a lot of vetting on that side? Do you do vetting on the side of the developers as well?\nJoe Masilotti 12:47\nNo, I do zero vetting on the side of the developers and I am upfront with that with the businesses. Like, I’m in charge of gathering some profiles of people for you. I’ll help you narrow them down. And you know, maybe I’ll send you a list of folks that are good potential good fits, but I’m assuming that what they write in their profiles is the truth. And I’m not going to go an interview for you. I’m not going to go and like read resumes for you. I’m not a recruiter. And that’s not the business that I’m building. If these developers are consistently getting feedback that they didn’t meet expectations, I will take action on that. But what I do help out is that any developer who is maybe not getting the results they want or expect or aren’t getting reached out to or feel like they could be doing a little better on the platform, I work with them one on one to kind of tweak their profile. And it’s not so much resume rewriting as it is self branding and self marketing. Like it’s so crazy how all it comes back to marketing. You have your little title and your little description on who you are as developer. That’s what someone’s going to click. You have to think about your showing up in search results like Google, what is going to make a business click to hire you. And I work on that with a lot of developers individually and anyone who wants to do that definitely send me a DM or an email, happy to help anyone. I’ve helped a ton of people do that. A few of the folks have actually gotten their first job through that, which is super exciting. And it doesn’t work for everyone, but it definitely helps. And that’s like as much of the, not even to use the term but like the vetting process that is involved on the developer side.\nArvid Kahl 14:24\nYep, sounds like a great opportunity for an info product. Like this could be like a 30 minute course or an e book or something, you know, like that kind of information probably gets stale rather quickly in the moving world. But still, right? It’s information that people could use. I’m happy you’re doing this because honestly I love this for the mere fact that you kind of let the developers run loose, do their thing, you know and you’re keeping pretty close eye on the company’s in that relationship from a developer’s perspective. And I guess also from businesses perspective. I really like this because you make sure that people get hired by quality companies. But there is a very diverse range of people of developers that people can choose from, that companies can actually hire. That is nice. It’s a great job board. And I think now I finally understand why you call it the reverse job board because it’s very different from the traditional company centric, like hiring manager centric of platforms that I see all over the place. Was that a consequence of the spreadsheet? Or is that something that you thought this is gonna be different than anything else in the market?\nJoe Masilotti 15:32\nI think it was both. It was a consequence of the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet proves some sort of product market fit, that having a list of a very small niche of developers, Ruby on Rails developers, and presenting that to people that are hiring Ruby on Rails developers, there’s obviously something there that I hit on. But when I set out to create RailsDevs, I didn’t want to just do a job board because A. it’s been done, it didn’t feel unique enough and I wasn’t excited about it. But it also didn’t feel like I was doing anything new or interesting to these developers that they couldn’t get elsewhere. So the reverse job board came about as, the more I dug into it, the more I researched the recruiting process, the more I just heard horror stories of people going through three hour interviews, eight hour interviews, 20 hour take home tests. I was like, this is broken. This is so broken right now in the tech space. How can we flip the script and give more power to the developers themselves getting hired? And that’s really the single value that I built all of RailsDevs off of, it’s how can we empower the individual developer to have them find their next job on their own terms. And that’s how the reverse job board was built. That’s why you can say what type of role you’re looking for. I don’t ask you if you’re a senior developer. I asked you what level role you’re looking for. It completely changes the script. It shows what you’re looking for next, not where you’re currently at or what you consider yourself or what your current title is. And that’s also why I removed compensation entirely from the website. I don’t want developers to sell themselves short by saying they charged 50 bucks an hour if they could be getting $75 an hour or $150 an hour or a $10,000 project from these companies. And it’s all centered around that. And it’s all centered around having these organic conversations between the developer and the person who’s going to hire them with no one in the middle. And that’s really where it all stemmed from. And that’s what the features are that exist. And you know, that’s how it’s continued being built.\nArvid Kahl 15:32\nYeah, I was going to ask you about this, like, how do you prioritize for which side you build features. But it sounds like you might be skewed quite heavily towards one of them, right?\nJoe Masilotti 17:48\nI don’t think I’ve had the problem of like, well, no, I take it back. Compensation was almost entirely request from the businesses. The businesses wanted to be able to sort and filter by developer rates. I was like, yeah, let’s do it sounds great. And it had a bunch of people work on it was, you know, live within a week and almost immediately was like, oh, crap, this sucks. This sucks for developers because they’re only going to sell themselves short. And it was removed within like two weeks after that. There’s a whole post on GitHub discussions about why I removed it. And even if you create your profile, it links still to it just because I want to make sure people are aware. So I think that that’s proven. And I’ve got a couple other small things. But if there’s ever a disagreement between it is better for the developer or better for the business, I’m going to lean strongly towards the developer side. And you know, there’s other things that will benefit the business that don’t hurt the developer that I’m happy to add. But if there’s ever that conflict, the developer is always gonna win.\nArvid Kahl 18:49\nThat makes perfect sense. And honestly, you’re building features that add value to the whole platform quite visibly, by the way. I watched you built your referral system in public in a live stream recently. I found that very interesting. And I have two questions about this. First of, how is building software in public? Do you enjoy it? Is that something that that is actually something? Yeah, not just a marketing thing, but something that you really like? And two, what parts of your software, of your system itself do you need to build yourself? Because referral systems are notoriously one of these things that you know, like authentication and all these kinds of things that developers like to build but probably shouldn’t? So what’s your stand on this?\nJoe Masilotti 19:27\nI’ll start with the second question first. I’m probably going to end up building the referral system out and then realize I need some crazy feature and then rip it all out and add a third party. That’s why I’m not letting anyone else build it because I feel bad ripping out their code in the future. I’m doing it myself. When I get there, I’ll know and I’ll change it. But for now, as you watch the live stream, it’s as simple as setting a cookie and adding a model to the database when someone signs up based on that cookie. I’m not getting crazy with it until I need to. To answer your first question, do I enjoy building features in public? Do I enjoy coding in public? I love it. It gives me so much energy and motivation. I got my start my real development start at a consultancy shop where I was doing pair programming eight hours a day, five days a week. Like, it was called Pivotal Labs at the time. It’s now changed a bunch and kind of like what ThoughtSpot is these days or Test Double even. But I thrive in that environment of having someone to bounce ideas off constantly. And I don’t really get that as a solo developer anymore. Yeah, I can pair with people every now and then. But I don’t have any coworkers, right? My one and a half year old isn’t coding with me yet, so. Not yet, at least. So the live streaming and the building in public, I kind of feel like I have that second or third or 100th pair of eyes watching me and being able to ask ideas and bounce stuff off of. If you follow the Twitter chat I use, you know, throw in air quotes, it was just the replies to the live stream. Marco was in there and Andrew was in there. And they were both debugging with me through Twitter chat. It was a terrible interface to do that. But I was like, they were helping me fix issues through Twitter, you know, replies to a tweet that I like, you know and things that are way more complicated than just syntax errors or like, oh, you forgot a semicolon at the end of that. More things like, oh, here are the docs for this method. You’re actually passing in the wrong parameter order. Stuff like that, where I was like, holy crap, you’re totally right. I didn’t nest the parameters the right way. Thank you, Marco, like crazy stuff like that. And that’s really where I get a lot of energy and a lot of motivation from.\nArvid Kahl 21:44\nYeah, I bet. For a developer, I think building in public is one of the most literal things that you can do, right? Like for a writer, for a marketer, building in public is more like an abstract term where you can build something in public. But for a coder, you can literally build your software in public and have this incredible feedback loop like you just described, that is so incredibly tight. It’s real time with other experts that are not even paid or interested in finding compensation. They just like helping. That’s really cool. I love this. Did you ever consider that this might be problematic? And I mean, not just like writing code. I mean, like, building in public in general, because, you know, I’m a big fan of building in public. But I also want to be realistic about it that there might be certain drawbacks, depending on what you do. Did you ever encounter anything like this? Or do you protect yourself against something when what would that be?\nJoe Masilotti 22:41\nYeah, great question. So I think that building code in public from my opinion, with the small exception of leaking a API key or something that’s like secret, like a credential. To me, I see zero risk in building code in public almost entirely because the code base that I’m contributing to is open source. RailsDevs is the whole code base is open source and things that are secret are the credentials that connect to you know, my database key and Heroku and all that stuff. So if I am writing proprietary information or a proprietary algorithm, it’s going to be on GitHub in a few hours anyway. There’s very little risk in me building in public. Again, the exception being leaking a credential or like command tabbing into my email client or something like that. But that’s just poor behavior. But I think that building in public in the more general sense of building a business in public carries way more risks with it that I’m starting to realize as I slowly make RailsDevs into a thing that is becoming more and more of my full time income. And it’s letting go of trade secrets when they are the core to your business. A lot of what I do on RailsDevs is public. I’d say that 90% of what I do on RailsDevs is public. I have the codebase is open source, all my metrics are public, my analytics are public through fathom. My business decisions are all done through GitHub discussions and people can weigh in on them and comment and reply and all that stuff. But there are definitely things that I don’t keep on those that I do like to keep quiet following Zero To Sold. I have an Operations Manual, right? Where when a new business signs up, I send them an email. I have a copy paste template that I am not going to share with the world. When a business kind of ghosts me and says that they’re not going to pay the hiring fee, I have a process that I follow. Those are the things that are very core to my business that I don’t think people will find interesting, but I also that’s what keeps the business alive. And the email and support that I do, those are the things that I’m not going to make public and those are the things that are what makes RailsDevs, RailsDevs. That it’s me running this thing and it’s my personality and you know me, Joe, that is not going to be made into a public doc or anything like that. So that’s where I draw the line with it all.\nArvid Kahl 25:06\nYou just turned this conversation into a build in public master class. And I’m very grateful for that. Because like finding that line, first of, understanding that there is a line that not everything should be transparent. But transparency doesn’t mean complete transparency, particularly not in front of your competitors, which is everybody on Twitter, potentially. But there’s more to gain by sharing certain things than not sharing them. And there is more to gain by not sharing certain things that can be shared, but probably shouldn’t. So it’s great that you drew this line. And I love the idea that your process, your internal structure, your procedures, the things that you set up, to keep the business humming, like the engine humming of your business, that these as the lifeblood of your business are your trade secret. And that’s the stuff you don’t talk about or you don’t share in the specificity that would allow others to duplicate it. And that’s what you usually see when businesses who used to be very transparent, reduce transparency. They just add another layer of, you know, diffusion of abstraction. They don’t talk about the specifics anymore. But they do mention that, right? They do mention that they have this particular process or they do this or they don’t do that, you know, that kind of information still gets out. Transistor is a good example. Transistor FM by Justin Jackson and Jon Buda, this business that used to share everything. And that was just, you know, talking more about general things, but it’s still sharing and I love that you’re on the same path. Good to know. And also good to know that you know because you will encounter moments where you might overshare a little and then over time, you know, have to reduce it or talk about things differently. But I love the fact that you already have this, you know, in your visor, you already see where this is heading. That’s great. I love this. And I love that you take openness to a new level because many software service businesses or generally software enabled businesses, like a job board would probably count very much as both, I don’t know, depends. Many of these businesses are not open source. They don’t really use the source code for that. But you do. And I love that fact that there are forked versions of RailsDevs out there, making people money connecting people in other fields of technology or even complete other industries, with people that they need for making business things happen. How did that come about? How did you set that up? And do you monetize this? Like how do you approach this in terms of a business choice? Because you spend time on it. So you know, better give you something in return.\nJoe Masilotti 27:35\nYeah, I think there’s two big questions there that I want to dive into. It’s why RailsDevs is open source to begin with? And then how do these other businesses that are forking RailsDevs? How am I involved, if at all? So the first question is kind of a silly answer. Working in Rails, you know, day in and day out, I always want to contribute to open source. I always want to like cracking, open the rails source code and like add a new method. But I’m always so intimidated by these kind of lower level framework type things, framework type gems. So I did a bunch of Googling and there was no real products that were open source that I could find that weren’t like, ginormous things like, you know, Dev.2 is, you know, open source both on forum and a number of others. There was no like, entry level small, medium sized projects that were products. So it’s like, you know what? Let’s make RailsDevs open source. What’s the worst that could happen? I can always closed source it later once it takes off. And I’m so glad that I did that. Because I’ve gotten 80 something people who contributed to the project, like a ridiculous amount of people in the year. And I think 20 of them if maybe 15. It’s their first open source contribution ever. That’s huge. That’s more exciting, right? That’s more exciting to me than actually getting people hired sometimes because it’s like, I just brought someone into the world of open source by reviewing a pull request. That’s all it took. But it actually took a whole year of building out a product that is boring and the technology isn’t exciting on that is open source to get there. So one of my big things with RailsDevs is that the code is kind of offensively boring. There’s nothing exciting going on. There’s barely any like front end JavaScript, even hotwire with Rails seven. It’s all boring rails straight out of the box, like convention over configuration stuff, which makes it really easy to contribute to because you kind of know where everything is and how it all works if you’re a Rails developer. And even if you’re not a Rails developer, a couple of Python devs have contributed over the year too, which is cool.\nArvid Kahl 29:35\nCool\nJoe Masilotti 29:36\nSo I really love that. I really have been able to contribute back to the community by saying like, oh, how does one do, you know, to integrate devise with this other third party library? Here’s my source code. Here’s the code that you could look at. Here’s the pull request. You can share that whatever who you want. It’s MIT license, copy, paste it, do whatever you want with it. You find a bug, maybe contribute back. That’s all I ask. So that’s been really cool and I would definitely would not change that for anything. But to answer your second question, forks. How do I deal with forks and clones and copycats and stuff? This is where things get interesting, right? Copycat of RailsDevs are encouraged. I have even in there, if you want to do RailsDevs for your own technology or own sector, follow these instructions, you’ll start here. And at the end, you’ll deploy to Heroku. And you’ll be live in production in like, a couple hours, depending on your level of skill there. And to my knowledge, there are about seven or eight forks of RailsDevs that are live in production right now. And they range. There is one for blockchain developers. There’s one for JavaScript developers. There’s one for private home chefs, which is really cool. There’s one that’s starting in the solar industry that’s coming out pretty soon from another local Portland Dev. Really cool stuff. And most of these people reach out to me and they say, hey, we’d love to pick your brain on this. Want to do a fork of RailsDevs. Like, can you answer a couple of questions? So we do all that. We answer a couple questions. And I say, oh, by the way, if you want to do this more often, I offer an advisory style engagement, whatever want to call it, where we can chat for a few hours a week or a month, whatever works for a small revenue share. So this is what I’m doing with a lot of these businesses now. I help them get deployed. Some of them, I read a little bit of code. For some of them, I only do support. Some of them, I only do marketing. Some of them, I do only like one call a month. So it varies. And they share revenue with me. And this is obviously a big bet on my end because I’m not getting paid for probably about a year for any of these businesses. And I’m putting in a lot of time and effort in making sure that they can get deployed and they can get live and ask me all these questions. But in the long run, there’s a double benefit to this. The first one is obvious. I make more money by only, by just helping people without having to write code and put in time and trade time for money. But two, there are no more code bases online that are built on rails. And that’s awesome. If they don’t open source it, that’s fine. But they see in the bottom of it. It was written by, you know, forked from Joe and they can see the code base. So having more Rails code out there in the wild, in my mind, is better for everyone.\nArvid Kahl 32:23\nWow! All of this is such an open source kind of long term perspective mindset that I’m just blown away by this, you know, because open source is notoriously hard to monetize for everybody. Like even MongoDB and all these rather sizable projects have trouble just justifying, monetizing it and then doing it in a way that doesn’t kind of mess things up for people that are not too big or not too small, like somewhere in the middle, right? It’s always hard to find these, like continuous spectrum of serving these kinds of people. But I love your approach is like, okay, let’s just give it to people. Let me give people even more of my time to make this good, which I think is also a rationale somewhere in there, right? You want their platforms to be the best they can possibly be, thus increasing their chance to succeed. And then eventually, potentially, hopefully, monetizing. That is so cool. And I love of course, I’m not a reels dev. I come from the JavaScript and elixir background, but I do have to pick X in my library and I was there a couple must have been like, eight, nine years ago, in that community for a little bit. So I do understand how important it is to keep projects like this going into the world and allowing people to see that this technology is still relevant, is getting better, you know, with every year and allows people not just from the technology perspective, but also from the just the openness of the community around it to do things and make money of them and improve their lives. That is just awesome. And you enabling this with this particular method of allowing the fork and then monetizing kind of around it in the future.\nJoe Masilotti 34:08\nYeah, yeah\nArvid Kahl 34:09\nThat is really smart. I would have expected some kind of flat licensing fee or you know, a revenue share with a minimum or something, right? Like where people try them immediately monetize something, but I see you playing the long game, the infinite game, really. And I can only applaud you for this. This is really cool.\nJoe Masilotti 34:29\nThanks. Yeah and the revenue share terms are what I think are pretty beneficial to both parties. It’s a certain amount of time depending on the agreement after their second customer. So what that means is that they can spend all the time that they want building and making this thing perfect and we can work together. But it’s not until they actually prove that they have fit that they’ve actually sold to their second customer. Does my like, does the clock start ticking on how much revenue I receive and it works out really well because it means that they don’t feel pressure to launch slow, so I make less, so they lose less money to me. And they’re not pressured to launch fast. So they feel obligated that I forgot my revenue share. They can work at their own pace. And when it takes off, if it does, it’s then the clock starts.\nArvid Kahl 35:17\nWow, yeah, well, you are very respectful with your fellow developers. I really, really appreciate that. And they probably appreciated much more than me. That’s just really nice. You were talking about that this is currently still I wouldn’t call it a side project, but a part time project. Is that right?\nJoe Masilotti 35:34\nYeah, it’s a one of the many businesses under my umbrella.\nArvid Kahl 35:39\nHow’s that going? Where is this going? Do you intend to, you know, full time this eventually?\nJoe Masilotti 35:45\nI don’t have any, I don’t have concrete plans to full time this in the next year. I don’t know where this will go in two years or three years or four years. As you can go find online, it went from zero to 150k in 12 months, like it is making substantial income for me right now. But I’m also still doing a lot of work in the turbo native space and kind of my more traditional consulting and advisory type work. And for now, I’m still playing both. I’m still working on both. I’m still doing workshops for turbo native. I’m still doing, you know, pair programming sessions. I’m still consulting. I’m still advising. RailsDevs is at the point where I can kind of, it’s definitely not just like sitting there and letting it simmer. But I don’t have to do as much active work to get new businesses anymore. I can tweet about it every once in a while. I can build a new feature every once in a while. I can send a couple cold emails and get a client and get a new customer too. It’s at the ideal state right now where it’s not growing, it’s not shrinking, but it’s bringing in substantial income every month or so. And that’s really perfect to me because I feel like if I want to go any bigger than that right now, I’d have to invest way more time and money into it. And then I worry that it wouldn’t become as fun as it is right now. Right now, I only deal with 10 businesses at most at a time. And that’s all I really need to be sustainable. Business comes for a month or two and then they leave because they hired someone, that’s a winner on everyone’s book. And if I am dealing with 50 businesses at a time for five times the revenue, is it worth it? I probably need a whole team. And I want to keep this solo for as long as possible. So for right now, I don’t have plans to 10 exit. I don’t have plans to make it my full time. I have plans to let it continue to grow organically as it’s growing now. And in a year, we’ll talk again and maybe my opinion will have changed. But maybe my forks will bring in more revenue, you never know. But that’s where I think about it now. And it’s still really fun and exciting even a year later. And I want to keep it that for 10 years. That’s my goal.\nArvid Kahl 37:57\nThat sounds like a good plan. I love this kind of very sustained and non hypergrowth approach to building a lifestyle business in the best sense of the word, right?\nJoe Masilotti 38:09\nYeah\nArvid Kahl 38:09\nA lifestyle that you want, that you enjoy, that doesn’t stress you out where don’t have the managerial responsibilities of managing a team. That’s something that I’m currently experimenting with because I’m feeling it’s time in my life to involve other people. And it’s enjoyable, but it is work, right? It’s not I can do whatever I want. I still can most of the time. There are responsibilities. And I understand that not wanting these is a perfectly valid approach to business. Now, since you’re saying this is not going to turn into anything major, but it’s also not like going down, right? It’s not much up, not much down. It’s just where it is. Have you ever considered selling the business for a significant multiple?\nJoe Masilotti 38:53\nYeah, I talked about this with my partner pretty often, just in general in terms of like, what’s the magic number? What’s like the life changing number that one of us could sell one of our things for that would be worth it. And that number is substantial, right? Because you think about 150k year, three years, even if it doesn’t grow that’s starting to get substantial money. That’s full income, practically. What is that number? We have an idea in mind. And if someone were to come to me and say, hey, here’s that number right here. Will you take it? I probably still say no. So I think that right now, I’m still so excited and passionate about this that I can’t possibly think of selling it in the near future. There’s always a number for these things. If someone came to me and said, hey, here’s $25 million for RailsDevs. Like I’d be silly not to take that. But that’s not gonna happen because the business isn’t worth $25 million right now. It might be in five years or in 10 years, but it’s not right now. And what I like and what I enjoy right now is growing it and being the face of it and talking about it online and continuing to build it and grow it in public. And if I sell it, I’ll have other things to work on. But right now, I’m pretty passionate about this. And that’s what I want to keep.\nArvid Kahl 40:07\nThat’s a great perspective. But there’s nothing wrong with keeping your business. And there’s nothing wrong with selling a business or anything you want to do as an entrepreneur. I mean, even like, quitting your business is an option, although you might just as well wanna sell it. But yeah, if you’re passionate for the thing that you do and you have a wish for how you want your life to look like and if you love giving workshops, if you love doing consulting as well, because it gets you, you know, involved in other people’s things that always knew always something challenging and it’s not just keeping the thing running, well, then you don’t need to sell. And if you ever get bored of something, if you ever get want something different or want to level up, build something even bigger and need the funds to do it, that’s a good opportunity to sell your business.\nJoe Masilotti 40:53\nExactly!\nArvid Kahl 40:53\nIf it’s not, well then it’s not. Let’s talk a bit about the workshops and the Turbo Native. From what I understand and you can probably tell I’m not very active in the rails and people who made rails and now run businesses that use Turbo Native in their client space. But talk to me a bit about that particular technology and the work that you do around it.\nJoe Masilotti 41:20\nYeah, so Turbo Native is a way to take your Ruby on Rails website, your mobile website and kind of shove it into an iPhone app. And you can deploy this app to the App Store. You can deploy it to Google Play if you have it on Android. And what it does is it renders your web views, it hits your server, it renders your HTML, your CSS, your JavaScript inside of a native kind of like frame. So you can have like a native tab bar and native navigation. But you have all the benefits of web inside of your mobile app. What this enables is really small teams to do crazy productive things. So you think about Basecamp and Hey, the 37 signals folks, they have really small, relatively dev teams for the number of requests and the number of customers that they have. Both of their apps are built on Turbo Native. Their mobile website is shoved into an iPhone app with Turbo Native and that’s their iOS app. And it goes a really long way because you’re not building this like transcompilation or language where you kind of have like, what’s that one called? The one by Google, but like Dart or is it called Dart?\nArvid Kahl 42:31\nTranspilers, I guess.\nJoe Masilotti 42:32\nYeah, Dart. Yeah. So like, Dart’s the one from Google or whatever it is. It’s not a thing where you’re writing, you know, a new language just to write your mobile app. So you’re actually leveraging all of the existing logic and views and design that you already have on the website. But you’re showing it on a native screen. And you have hooks into like, fully native screens if you wanted to. So if you wanted to integrate with like the contact book or native maps or push notifications, you have hooks into doing that, that drops you down into native code, Swift or Kotlin or depending on your platform. So what I do is I work with clients that have a Ruby on Rails website and they want to get in the app store for whatever reason, usually, it’s push notifications. And they come to me and they say, hey, Joe, we have this mobile website. Can you put it into the App Store? And I say, sure, it’ll be two months and it’ll cost you this much money or it’ll take three months or seven weeks is my record, actually and I do everything for them. I write the Rails code that’s needed to work with Turbo Native. I build the iPhone app for them. I get all their assets ready. I deploy to the app store. I write their copy for the marketing. Pretty much, they just sign off on a bunch of things. And we’re good to go. So that’s what I do. That’s like my bread and butter. What I’ve realized is that I’m very expensive for what I charge because it’s so niche. I’m like one of the only few people that do it, that not everyone can afford that, which is fair. So what I’m doing now is I’m enabling individuals to learn how to do Turbo Native on their own, which is exactly what this workshop is that I’m actually hosting in from the recording three days from the recording. My first one of these, which is a three hour hands on interactive, like live coding workshop, where we go from like brand new X code project brand new Rails app to what you could, in theory, deploy to the App Store in three hours. And you’re gonna be able to leave that workshop with everything you need to know to like get your hands dirty and enough to be dangerous with Turbo Native. So you won’t be able to you know, copy and paste this thing into your production app, but you will be able to then make the tweaks you need to go and get that live.\nArvid Kahl 43:10\nIn an ideal future, five years from now\nJoe Masilotti 44:51\nYeah\nArvid Kahl 44:52\nWould you rather be giving workshops or going down to Turbo Native style rabbit hole or would you want to be solopreneur running a fully full time, SaaS business or something like that?\nJoe Masilotti 45:09\nThis is a question that I asked myself every month in some shape or form and I give you pause because, I give pause because it’s always a struggle and internal struggle with me. Right now, I can’t think of doing anything else besides RailsDevs. I want to spend every waking minute working on RailsDevs. And this workshop is like, oh, that’s Thursday? I forgot about that, you know. But last week, when I was putting the final touches on the workshop and tweaking the UI of the demo app we’re building and adding a really new awesome native screen, I was like, RailsDevs, what is that? I want to be full time Turbo Native workshop guy, day in and day out. So I think that my answer to you is, I don’t want to do one single thing for the rest of my life. I think that I get way too bored with individual things. And I need variety in my life. My life and my business more importantly, that if I pigeon holed myself into one thing, I would get bored of it and burnt out and stop caring and probably stop working on it. So having this balance of solopreneur, low touch SaaS along with high touch consultancy, along with like, middle touch, workshop or whatever, that’s my sweet spot. And maybe those three things will change throughout my life and my career. But right now, that is perfect for me.\nArvid Kahl 46:33\nYeah, who knows what you’re going to add to this or subtract from it at some point in the future. I think Daniel Vassallo would be very happy with that approach, you know, because it’s many small bets. It’s the idea of having different things, different kinds of things that you do low touch, high touch, time for money, you know, just money for time, like all kinds of variety somewhere in there. It’s really, really cool to see your reasoning about this because obviously, there is no perfect path. There might be a perfect path for you. But that is not for you to know until you walk it, right? So and it’s definitely not for me to understand before either. So I’m just really trying to figure out what your thought process is behind this. Because I know that so many founders struggle with this, that kind of what should I do? Where should I go? What should I not do? Like, what are the things that are keeping me from reaching the other thing, but having a balance between things and splitting your attention, almost like kind of a shiny object syndrome situation where there’s always something that is more exciting, I think that’s perfectly fine. Honestly, that’s how I work too, like sometimes I write for days at a time. And I just over the last couple days, I think I wrote three or four articles for the next couple of months because I thought I want to talk about these topics because I know, I’m gonna have interviews with these people around those days. So I want to kind of push that in there as well. I was super excited. And today’s like, no, I’m not gonna write. I’m gonna deal with the video stuff because that is also really cool. And I want to do it. I think too often are we pushed into, you should only do one thing and do it right and do it forever 50 years, get your watch and then you go into retirement, right? That’s the perspective that is still pushed onto us, even though it’s very much unrealistic. So I’m glad to see what is going on for you. Okay, one question I have. Oh, please go ahead.\nJoe Masilotti 48:18\nYeah, one more thing on that. I think that you said it really well there, you kind of summarized a viewpoint that I have on it. That following your passion doesn’t mean following one thing forever. But it also doesn’t mean following a passion for weeks or months. That could be your passion of the hour or your passion of the day. And leaning into that is when you’re going to do your best work, it’s when I do my best work. And when I try to fight that when I say I have to write for three hours on Tuesday, is when I write crap or I don’t write at all and I have three cups of coffee. And I’m you know, on my Instagram the rest of the day or whatever. Like, it’s when I follow my passion and I say, oh, I have this great idea for an article and I wake up at 5am. And I write that from start to finish. It’s published at 7am. That’s when I do my best work.\nArvid Kahl 49:00\nYeah, creative work knows no timeboxing, right? It happens when it happens. And hopefully you have a pen and paper or an ocean dock or something to yell into, hopefully with a recording function. Otherwise, you’re just yelling into a phone. But you know, it’s really important to understand that creative work and that is coding too. Like the other side of the brain level, that is creative work, right? Like if you come up with new algorithms, new modules or an extension for something that you think could actually be a new feature or whatever also greater, right? Just as much as creating a new slide for your course or writing a new cold email. And it’s kind of what I wanted to talk to you about because I saw over the last couple days you’ve been talking about cold email and marketing and since you are entrenched in two very different spaces, like in the job boards world and the course or workshop creation world. Did you find any overlap between these in terms of marketing or do you have a completely distinct approaches to this? How do you market your self and the things that you sell?\nJoe Masilotti 50:02\nGreat question! I have found little overlap in the marketing of these two products. We’ll call them selling RailsDevs to businesses and selling my workshop or my consultancy work to businesses. The cold emailing that I’m doing now is almost exclusively to businesses that have posted interest or expressed interest or posted a job on a job board and said, I’m looking for a Rails developer. Here’s the job description. Those are people that I know are my target audience. I need a way to just get them to reply to me. If I get them to reply to me, there’s a good chance I can get them on to try RailsDevs for at least a month. Those cold emails are where I’m really experimenting with sending cold is interesting. But the word cold is interesting because they’re very customized. I’m finding the person’s real name, the real email address there, the job description. I’m sending them five links to developers who like could be a good fit, like I’m putting in 15-25 minutes of work into each one of these emails. So it’s still cold, but it’s not automated. And that’s something that I don’t think I’ll ever do. Marketing to other developers for the workshop and marketing to businesses for my Turbo Native work is practically 100% content marketing. It’s me tweeting about Tturbo Native, building in public and releasing small open source libraries. It’s being a maintainer of the library itself and getting my name in there and commit access and stuff. It’s blogging about it, it’s writing tutorials on it. It’s my newsletter that I talked about Turbo Native almost every single month. It’s all of that stuff to generate inbound leads. I rarely, if ever will reach out to companies and be like, hey, do you want a Turbo Native app? Because odds are, they don’t. If they do, they probably know who I am at this point. And they probably either don’t want to work with me for whatever reason or I’m too expensive. And that’s fine. So I let everything with that side of my business become inbound and everything with RailsDevs or that isn’t, you know, organic is cold email marketing right now.\nArvid Kahl 52:14\nSo that’s the kind of business side of RailsDevs. But the developer side, how do you reach these people?\nJoe Masilotti 52:19\nYeah, that’s kind of exactly how I reach the developers on the Turbo Native side, it’s all building in public, it’s having the open source library. A lot of where I’ve seen developers come from, is like, I’ll post a question on Twitter and be like, hey, I don’t know how to do this in Rails, like, here’s some code and I link to the RailsDevs repo like a pull request or code. And it’s like, it’s very innocent because I’m posting to the code that I’m talking about. It just so happens to be in the repo that I want someone to sign up for. So it’s this nice little feedback loop where I ask for feedback, there’s genuine questions, I get someone to, you know, help me with a reply or telling me that I’m being silly and I should use other jam or whatever. They sometimes submit a pull request, which is even better. I close that out. They now are aware of RailsDevs. People have seen that conversation happen in public, maybe someone learned something from it, maybe now someone knows to use this gem instead of doing what I was trying to do. And in the future that’s documented for everyone on the repo. The best way that I’ve seen this work is having issues on the GitHub repo that are open for new contributors. This gets new people into the platform. It gets new contributors to open source software. And then when it gets merged, I can shout them out on Twitter with a link to their pull request and say thank you, which has actually gotten someone a job before. So it’s like this really cool full cycle loop where I’m able to, you know, amplify developer work, while getting quote free labor from them that they were totally willing to offer for me and free exposure. I mean, it just checks all the boxes. It really does.\nArvid Kahl 53:55\nThat’s so cool. Yeah, that is also such a clear brand that you’re building around the business and yourself. Like you’re almost quite literally a job creator. Even, you know, if you take the job away from this, it’s still true. I guess it’s really, really cool to see like all your efforts aiming at empowering software developers to find work or to make things that make them find work. That’s just really nice. And I think it comes around to you too. I’ve seen a lot of very positive testimonials out there about this platform, the process how people got jobs, like how you helped. Have you been like actively looking for these? Like I’m also always looking for testimonials, right? As a creator that’s the thing that that gives us credibility. Are you using any particular tools or particular process to capture these and then use it again to find more people?\nJoe Masilotti 54:46\nYes, I’m collecting all the testimonials through testimonial.to. You had Damon on just recently, right?\nArvid Kahl 54:54\nYeah, number two. Interview number two.\nJoe Masilotti 54:55\nYeah, I just finished listening to that. So I use his tool, which I love. It’s a great way to just send a link and someone can do a video or a text testimonial right there and it’s all beautiful and like this wall of love that you can embed on your website or I copy paste because I’m finicky with my included JavaScript. I like to have everything the way I want it. But the website still works great in terms of collecting. And my approach for collecting it is that if I know that someone got a job or I am aware that someone may be setting their profile, they’re no longer looking. Or it’s been a while since they had contact with someone, I’ll reach out and say, hey, you know, how are things going? Keep me updated, anything exciting going on. It’s not a cold email. But it is a manually copy and pasted generated email with some tweaking going on. And I got a pretty good success rate on responses on that. If someone says they get hired, boom, where can I send you some some stickers, a mug, handwritten thank you card? And if you’re up for it, can you write a testimonial for me? Like, I’m gonna send you all this awesome stuff in a really cool box. It’d be great if you could just write a sentence or two about how you found your experience with RailsDevs. And that’s worked really well. People are really excited to share. I mean, what better achievement do you have than getting like your next job? It’s a huge upgrade, usually a huge milestone. They want to spread the love, they want to share where they found it, they want to help other people. And those testimonials really reflect that. And they then share their testimonial on their own Twitter and you know, just like this loop keeps happening and happening. It’s great.\nArvid Kahl 56:29\nThe feedback loops of building in public and empowering people in public, that are just incredible. Like they make things happen that you could not imagine if you were just sitting there hiding from public, the public world and doing your thing. What you’re doing is wonderful. It’s amazing. Yeah, my mind has been regularly blown over the last hour about like how thoughtful you are, in how you engage with the community, how you focus on the people with the least power in this very complicated job dynamics, how you make absolutely sure that they get the best deal possible while still empowering also the companies that choose to work with you, how you teach people to do stuff, to sell to other companies. It’s just wonderful, man. That is so cool. I’m just so happy that you’re on and sharing all these nuggets. Where can people go to find out more about you and your wonderful build in public work?\nJoe Masilotti 57:25\nYes, so most of my content is published on Twitter. I’m Joe Masilotti. There’ll be a link in the show notes. I blog on masilotti.com. That’s been a little less frequently, but starting very soon, that will change. I have some surprises coming for the new year. And then I also have a newsletter there that you can subscribe that’s only monthly. So it’s pretty light rounds up a bunch of links about hotwire and what I’m working on.\nArvid Kahl 57:50\nVery cool. Thank you so much for sharing all your insights here today. That was really, really cool.\nJoe Masilotti 57:56\nYeah, I really appreciate it, Arvid. This has been a blast. I’ve been really looking forward to this like all week, especially after two rescheduling. So thank you for dealing with that. Thank you for having me on. And I can’t wait to listen to this when it comes out.\nArvid Kahl 58:08\nAbsolutely. Thanks so much.\nAnd that’s it for today. Thank you for listening to The Bootstrapped Founder.

    "maintext": "We are short Tingo Group Inc (NASDAQ:TIO) because we believe the company is an exceptionally obvious scam with completely fabricated financials.\nTingo, headquartered in New Jersey, claims to have several business segments focused on providing mobile phones, food processing and an online food marketplace for farmers primarily located in Nigeria.\nTingo was founded and is spearheaded by “Dozy” Mmobuosi, CEO of the key holding company entity. Dozy is regularly described by the media as a billionaire and made waves earlier this year when he attempted to acquire the now-Premier League soccer team Sheffield United.\nWe’ve identified major red flags with Dozy’s background. For starters, he appears to have fabricated his biographical claim to have developed the first mobile payment app in Nigeria. We contacted the app’s actual creator, who called Dozy’s claims “a pure lie”.\nDozy claimed to have received a PhD in rural advancement from a Malaysian university in 2007. We contacted the school to verify the degree. They wrote back saying no one by his name was found in their verification system.\nIn 2017, Dozy was arrested and faced an 8-count indictment over issuance of bad checks, according to the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. He later settled the case in arbitration.\nIn 2019, Dozy claimed to have launched “Tingo Airlines” and posted social media messages encouraging customers to “fly with Tingo Airlines today”. Media outlets later uncovered that Tingo had photoshopped its logo onto pictures of airplanes. Dozy later admitted to never owning any actual aircraft.\nIn April 2023, Tingo’s Co-Chairman wrote a public letter to Dozy, filed with the SEC, saying he could not approve the company’s annual report and felt it “necessary to recuse myself by resigning” due to “many critical questions, comments and recommendations” that went “unanswered and unheeded”.\nTingo’s food division is 7 months old, yet claimed to generate $577.2 million in revenue last quarter alone, representing 68% of total reported revenue. If accurate, its claimed 24.8% operating margins would exceed those of every major comparable food company.\nYet, Tingo has no food processing facility of its own. Rather, it claims its explosive revenue and profitability is derived from acting as a middleman between Nigerian farmers and an unnamed third-party food processor.\nIn February 2023, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for a planned $1.6 billion Nigerian food processing facility of its own, attended by the country’s agriculture minister and other political luminaries.\nWe found that the rendering of the planned facility, featured in Tingo’s investor materials and on a billboard at the ceremony, is actually a rendering of an oil refinery from a stock photo website.\nFollowing its groundbreaking, Tingo reported in a May 2023 SEC filing that it made “significant progress” on the facility, including laying “the foundations of its numerous buildings”.\nWe visited the site a week later and found zero signs of progress; it was empty except for the plaque and billboard commemorating the groundbreaking ceremony, surrounded by weeds.\nSubsequent to the “groundbreaking”, Tingo announced a $150 million agreement with a UK entity called Evtec Energy to build solar panels for its non-existent food processing facility. Funding for the deal is slated to be provided through Evtec, but UK filings show that Evtec was “Dormant” as of its most recent annual report and held zero cash in the bank.\nTingo Group bought Tingo Foods from Dozy in February 2023 for $204 million, a price “approximately equal to the cost value of the inventory held by Tingo Foods”.\nThe inventory, which was reported in year-end financials, completely vanished from Tingo’s Q1 2023 accounts without explanation. In our experience, $204 million in inventory doesn’t just disappear at companies with internal controls and genuine financial reporting.\nTingo claimed in its reverse merger press release that members of 2 unnamed farming cooperatives supply the majority of its then-9.3 million userbase, consisting of local Nigerian farmers. These farmers supposedly form the core of the company’s phone customers and provide the agricultural products used in Tingo’s food processing and trading businesses.\nA local media outlet identified and contacted the cooperatives. Both said they had never heard of Tingo and had fewer than 100 farmers in each cooperative.\nWe were able to make contact with one of the cooperatives. Its owner reiterated having no relationship with Tingo and flat out told us “they are scammers”.\nTingo claimed its mobile handset leasing, call and data segments generated $128 million in revenue last quarter (~15% of total), claiming these services are provided through an agreement with Airtel in Nigeria. The type of license they claim did not exist until June, 2023.\nOur checks with the Nigerian Communications Commission showed it has no record of Tingo being a mobile licensee at all, despite company claims of having 12 million mobile customers.\nDespite claiming to have millions of farmers using its phones, Tingo Mobile’s corporate presentation and webpage uses stock photos of farmers using phones.\nWe visited Tingo Mobile’s office in Nigeria and found only a handful of employees and a sign posted on its door by federal tax authorities stating that the company is delinquent on its tax obligations.\nTingo Mobile claimed a Ghana expansion effort would enroll 2-4 million members by February 2023. This would represent ~9%-18% market share in the country within months of launch. We found zero records pertaining to Tingo Mobile through Ghana’s communication regulator.\nWe tried to contact Tingo’s Ghana support in late May to buy a phone. The email bounced back and no one picked up the phone despite numerous attempts.\nWe visited Tingo’s Ghana office location in late May 2023. We saw 2 cars in the parking lot and no customers. When we tried to enroll in a plan and buy a phone we were told the location wasn’t operational yet.\nTingoPay (part of Tingo Mobile) claimed in 2021 to have launched a partnership with a major local bank.\nTwo days after Tingo’s blockbuster announcement, the bank put out a statement calling Tingo’s claim false and that it had “NOT concluded any agreement with Tingo International in respect of any payment system whatsoever”.\nTingo now claims its payment group has a point of sale (PoS) system and other merchant products. We found that pictures of Tingo’s claimed PoS system were taken from a different PoS operator’s website, with a Tingo logo photoshopped over them.\nTingo claims its “seed to sale” online marketplace called NWASSA generated $125.3 million in revenue last quarter or ~15% of its total revenue, yet the website has been “under maintenance” and inoperable for months.\nTingo claims it has launched its NWASSA platform in Ghana. The Ghana website also doesn’t work and just says “Updating…” without ever going anywhere.\nIn a May 2023 press release, Tingo claimed its brand-new agricultural export business, Tingo DMCC, was on track to deliver over U.S. $1.34 billion in exports by Q3.\nTingo’s sales projections for that business are higher than the entire nation of Nigeria’s annual 2022 agricultural exports, which totaled about U.S. $1.15 billion, per government data.\nDespite Tingo’s bold claims, we found no import/export records from Tingo at all through searches of Nigerian customs and trading databases.\nTingo DMCC’s website has numerous non-functioning links and includes a fake testimonial that appears leftover from the website template.\nTingo’s financial statements are riddled with errors and typos, including a note to itself that it apparently forgot to delete, saying “please update for the tingle (sic) transaction including the tingle (sic) foods transaction”.\nIts financials include other basic errors like incorrect math and leaving zeroes off key metrics.\nMore troublingly, Tingo’s cash flow and balance sheet statements do not reconcile and show major errors indicating a complete lack of financial controls. Its cash flow statements regularly subtract items from cash that should be added and vice versa.\nThe errors also seem to apply to Tingo’s audited annual financial statements, which were recently given an unqualified audit opinion by Deloitte Israel (a strange choice given the company lacks substantive operations in Israel).\nWe strongly suspect Tingo’s cash balance, which it conveniently claims is held in Nigeria, is fake. The company collected only ~12% of the interest income one would expect from its claimed cash balances.\nOverall, we think Tingo is a worthless and brazen fraud that should serve as a humiliating embarrassment for all involved. We do not expect the company will be long for this world.\nInitial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of Tingo Group Inc (NASDAQ:TIO). This report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.\nIntroduction And Basics On The Business\nTingo Group (NASDAQ:TIO) is a holding company that claims to operate primarily in Nigeria in multiple business segments, including (i) food processing and sales (ii) mobile handset sales & leasing and (iii) an online food marketplace called “Nwassa”. The company has a fully diluted market capitalization of ~$1.5 billion as of this writing, with a recent peak market value of ~$3 billion as of May 22nd, 2023.[1]\nThe company first went public in August 2021 on the OTC market through a reverse merger with a Thai company that originally intended to acquire a third-tier crypto exchange.\nIn December 2022, the company entered the Nasdaq by closing another reverse merger with a listed Chinese fintech company. The company was renamed Tingo Group Inc and the ticker changed from MICT to TIO on February 27, 2023.\nTingo was founded in 2001 in Nigeria by “Dozy” Mmobuosi, who currently serves as the CEO of Tingo Group Holdings, the group’s key holding company entity.[2] He has gained international attention, gracing the cover of GQ Africa in December 2022.\nRegularly described by media as a billionaire, Dozy made further waves in February 2023 when he attempted to buy Sheffield United, an English football team recently promoted to the Premier league. [1,2,3,4] The deal stalled over questions about whether Dozy’s financial resources were genuine.\n(Source: CNN interview February 2023, in which Dozy faced questions about his finances)\nPart I: Red Flags In Dozy’s Background\nTingo Group Holdings CEO “Dozy” Mmobuosi Appears To Have Fabricated His Biographical Claim To Have Developed The First Mobile Payment App In Nigeria\nWe Contacted The Actual Creator Of The App Who Called Dozy’s Claim “A Pure Lie”\nDespite his claims to be a successful billionaire entrepreneur, we found numerous red flags related to Dozy.\nIn a May 2020 interview, Dozy told a detailed origin story of what would later serve as a key biographical claim; how, in 2002, he developed the first mobile payment platform in Nigeria. Per the story, he partnered with a bank on the venture after he couldn’t find an easy way to send money to his brother.\nAt the end of the interview, Dozy claimed he could not mention the product or the bank due to confidentiality reasons:\n“Understandably, I can’t mention the product or the bank in question for the sake of confidentiality.”\nThe lack of disclosure of the mere name of a company built and sold over 15 years ago runs contrary to the norm for essentially every other successful startup founder’s story.\nRegardless, his reticence to disclose the name of the app seems to have gone away. The Tingo website now claims Dozy helped launch Nigeria’s first SMS banking solution called “Flashmecash”. Per the website:\n“In 2002 he (Dozy) led the design and launch of Nigeria’s first SMS Banking Solution (Flashmecash), later sold to FMCB who still use it today.”\nWe reached out to Flashmecash’s actual creator, Deji Oguntonade, whom we verified as the inventor via check of Flashmecash’s patent, along with web searches. He informed us that Dozy’s claims were “totally false” and shared a WhatsApp post he wrote to Nigeria’s top fintechs and regulators making clear that Dozy’s claims were a “pure lie”.\nThe post provided a detailed background on the app, which Oguntonade reiterated had no connection to Dozy.\n(Source: LinkedIn message with Hindenburg researcher)\nDozy Claimed To Have Received a PhD In Rural Advancement From Malaysian University UPM In 2007\nWe Contacted UPM To Verify The Degree. They Wrote Back Saying No One By His Name Was Found In Their Verification System\nIn his Tingo biography, Dozy claimed to have received a PhD in Rural Advancement from Malaysian university UPM in 2007. We contacted the school to confirm this credential. An administrator in the graduate studies department confirmed that the database has records from 2007 and earlier, but that Dozy’s name, including several variations we tried were “not found for verification”.[3]\nIn 2017, Dozy Was Arrested And Faced An 8-Count Indictment Over Issuance Of Bad Checks, According To The Nigerian Economic And Financial Crimes Commission\nIn 2017, Dozy was arrested in Nigeria and faced 8 charges including conspiracy, obtaining by false pretense and issuance of approximately U.S. $70,000 in bad checks, according to the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The case was later settled in arbitration, according to local media and company filings. [Pg. 13]\n(Source: Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Official Facebook page)\nIn 2019, Dozy Claimed To Launch “Tingo Airlines” And Posted Social Media Messages Encouraging Customers To “Fly With Tingo Airlines Today”\nMedia Outlets Uncovered That Tingo Had Photoshopped Its Logo On Pictures Of Airplanes. Dozy Later Admitted To Never Owning Any Actual Aircraft\nIn August 2019, Dozy launched Tingo Airlines, which declared share capital of £1 billion, according to UK company records.\nPer reporting by The Athletic, November 2020 Facebook messages urged customers to “fly with Tingo Airlines today”.\nThe company also had an Instagram page where it posted photoshopped pictures of planes with a Tingo logo on them. The page was removed after observers noticed that the planes had too many windows and were missing a door, owing to a poor photoshop job.\n(Pictured: Tingo Airlines fake photoshopped planes. Source: The Athletic, which located the pictures from the since-deleted @TingoAirlines Instagram account)\nDozy later confessed in a CNN interview to never owning the planes, blaming the failed launch of the airline on Covid.\nIn April 2023, Tingo’s Co-Chairman Wrote A Public Letter To Dozy, Filed With The SEC, Saying He Could Not Approve The Company’s Annual Report And Felt It “Necessary To Recuse Myself By Resigning” Due To “Many Critical Questions, Comments And Recommendations” That Went “Unanswered And Unheeded”\nIn September 2021, Christophe Charlier was named co-Chairman of Tingo Inc., tweeting at the time that he was “excited” to work toward “transforming rural farming communities.”\nHowever, less than 2 years later, in April 2023, Charlier resigned suddenly, stating in a letter addressed to Dozy and filed with the SEC:\n“I have made numerous efforts to implement best corporate governance practices…Despite my efforts…many critical questions, comments and recommendations which I have sent to management and the Board have once again remained unanswered and unheeded. As a result, I will not be in a position to approve the 10K for 2022 prepared by management and feel it necessary to recuse myself by resigning from the Board”.[4]\nPart II: Red Flags With Tingo Foods\nWhen reviewing Tingo’s claimed business segments and operations, we begin to understand why Charlier may have made his decision.\nTingo’s Food Division Claimed To Generate $577.2 Million In Revenue And $143.5 Million In Operating Income Last Quarter Alone, Representing ~68% Of Reported Revenue And 24.8% Operating Margins\nThe vast majority of Tingo’s claimed revenue is derived from Tingo Foods, an entity that was formed in August 2022. The company claims, within the exact same filing, that it “commenced food processing operations” in August 2022 and September 2022.[5] [Pg. 8]\nTingo acquired the 7-month-old entity from Dozy in February 2023 via a $204 million, 2-year, 5% promissory note. [Pg. 28]\nDespite the entity existing for less than a year, Tingo’s quarterly report said Tingo Foods generated a whopping $577.2 million in just 2 months (February and March), putting it on pace for $3.4 billion in annual revenue and $861 million in annual operating income. [Pg. 18]\nTingo Claims Its Explosive Revenue Growth And Industry Leading Margins Are Generated By Acting As A Middleman Between Farmers And An Unnamed Third Party That Manages Its Food Processing\nTingo doesn’t have a processing facility of its own. Rather, the company claims that it has outsourced its processing to an unnamed third party. [Pg. 13] Despite simply acting as a middleman, Tingo claims its operating margins, a key measure of profitability, are higher than every major food company on earth at 24.8%.\n(Source: FactSet, Tingo’s press release [Pg. 2], Hindenburg analysis)\nWe checked Tingo Foods’ website to learn more about its unparalleled profitability and its outsourced partner. It provided virtually no information. The website’s “products” section consisted of only 4 stock photos of food items with no details on its services.\nIn February 2023, Tingo Held A Groundbreaking Ceremony For Construction Of A $1.6 Billion Food Processing Facility\nThe Rendering Of The Planned Facility, Featured In Tingo’s Investor Materials And On A Billboard At The Groundbreaking Ceremony Is A Picture Of An Oil Refinery From A Stock Photo Website\nTingo seems unsatisfied with its industry-leading operating margins earned by working with its mystery processing partner. In early 2023, the company announced plans to construct a $1.6 billion food processing facility in Nigeria, with completion scheduled for mid-2024. [Pg. 28]\nCompany presentations and other advertisements showed a rendering of the planned facility, as seen below from local media:\n(Source: This Day newspaper [Pg. 42])\nThe same picture appeared in Tingo’s investor presentation and was featured on a billboard at the groundbreaking of the facility, held on February 9th, 2023. [Pg. 8]\nThe ceremony was attended by luminaries of government, including the minister of Agriculture, along with numerous local leaders and other attendees. Media covered the event extensively, which featured local dancers and other fanfare.\nAn internet search reveals that the rendering of Tingo’s planned facility in its investor materials and its groundbreaking billboard matches a picture from stockphoto website ArtStation. Metadata from the stockphoto page indicates that the picture has been for sale since 2018, 5 years prior to Tingo’s use of the photo.[6] The site licenses the picture for $209.\nFurthermore, the picture is titled “A large completed Refinery”. Tingo apparently chose a stock photo of an oil refinery to represent its food processing facility.\nFollowing Its Groundbreaking, Tingo Reported In A May 2023 SEC Filing That It Made “Significant Progress” On The Facility Including Laying “The Foundations of Its Numerous Buildings”\nWe Visited The Site A Week Later And Found Zero Signs Of Progress, Including No Foundations\nThe Site Was Empty, But For The Plaque And Cinderblocks Commemorating The Groundbreaking Ceremony, The Billboard With The Stock Oil Refinery Photo, A Rail Container And Overgrown Weeds\nIn its Q1 2023 results filing, reported May 15th, Tingo said that since its groundbreaking, it has made significant progress:\n“Since then [the groundbreaking ceremony], significant progress has been made on the construction of the facility including the installation of infrastructure, drainage, water supply and the foundations of its numerous buildings.”\nIntrigued at how the company could so rapidly move from buying a stock photo of an oil refinery to laying “foundations of its numerous buildings”, we decided to pay the site a visit on May 24th, 2023.\nWe found several cinderblocks that were in place as part of the ceremony, but not one single additional brick or additional site prep, despite the company’s claims and supposedly being only 18-24 months away from targeted completion.\n(Pictured: Tingo’s claimed in-construction food processing facility, May 24th 2023, showing a pile of cinderblocks)\n(Pictured: Tingo’s groundbreaking ceremony, showing the same bricks and commemorative placard seen in our visit months later)\nClick here to see a brief video of a 360 degree look at the site, which consists solely of the sign with the stock photo of the oil refinery, overgrown brush, a shipping container, and the plaque commemorating the groundbreaking.\nTingo Announced A $150 Million Agreement With A UK Entity Called Evtec Energy To Build Solar Panels For Its Non-Existent Food Processing Facility\nUK Filings Show That Evtec Was “Dormant” As Of Its Most Recent Annual Report, And Held Zero Cash In The Bank\nOn February 22, 2023, as part of its food processing facility project, Tingo announced an agreement with UK-based Evtec Energy Plc. Together, the two planned to build a $150 million solar plant near Tingo’s food-processing facility using Evtec’s “advanced energy-tech”, with Evtec footing the bill.\nEvtec Energy’s UK filings show that the entity was dormant as of its most recent 2022 annual report, and held exactly zero cash in the bank at the time:\nEvtec’s name was in fact only recently changed to Evtec; it was called “UK Investment Securities Plc” until September 2022.\nGiven the above, it is difficult for us to believe Tingo’s claims that any funding would be provided through Evtec, or that it had any “advanced energy-tech”—rather it appears it was a dormant shell company now being used to prop up Tingo’s claims.[7]\nAt risk of pummeling readers with the obvious, from our site visit on May 24, 2023, we found no evidence of any development at all, solar or otherwise.\n(Photo: Tingo’s claimed in-construction food processing facility, May 24, 2023. No solar panels in sight.)\nAll told, we strongly suspect Tingo’s claimed food processing business is completely fraudulent.\nThe Company Bought Tingo Foods From Dozy In February 2023 For $204 Million, A Price “Approximately Equal To The Cost Value Of The Inventory Held By Tingo Foods”\nThe Inventory, Which Was Reported In Year-End Financials, Completely Vanished From Tingo’s Q1 2023 Accounts Without Explanation\nAs noted above, Tingo acquired Tingo foods in February 9, 2023. [Pg. 9] The purchase price was based on the cost of Tingo Foods’ claimed inventory at the time, per a later Tingo proxy statement filed with the SEC:\n“As consideration for the Acquisition, TINGO GROUP agreed to pay Mr. Mmobuosi a purchase price approximately equal to the cost value of the inventory held by Tingo Foods, to be satisfied by the issuance of a secured promissory note (“Promissory Note”) in the amount of US$204,000,000.” [Pg. F-95]\nThese inventories correspond closely to Tingo Foods’ audited financial statements, which show it had about $201.1 million in inventory as of year-end 2022. [Pg. 10] [8]\nHowever, the Q1 2023 10-Q – in which Tingo Foods is consolidated – has zero mentions of inventory. Not a single line for inventory on the balance sheet, nor changes in inventory on the statement of cash flows, nor any other mention at all.[9]\nThere is no attempted explanation in the filing for how $204 million in inventory that had been acquired less than 2 months earlier had vanished entirely.\nWe suspect no inventory ever existed because Tingo Foods as a whole seems to not exist. As we explore later, Tingo’s financial statements are rife with other major red flags indicating that they are likely completely fabricated.\nPart III: Tingo Mobile\nTingo Claimed Its Mobile Handset Leasing, Call And Data Segments Generated $128 Million In Revenue Last Quarter (~15% Of Total)\nCore to Tingo’s claims is that it has a massive userbase consisting of rural farmers that use its mobile products. These users serve as the backbone of the entire company as Tingo claims to offer the farmers other services like food processing and food exports.\nAccording to SEC filings, Tingo Mobile was launched by Dozy in 2001, the earliest division of the company. [Pg. 22] Archived versions of Tingo’s website claimed that it rapidly expanded upon launch, having completed the “design and distribution of 8 million phones for Nigerian farmers” by March 2014.\nTingo apparently managed to achieve this feat without the benefit of a website. The Tingo Mobile website was created in October 2015, according to DNS records.\n(Source: GoDaddy Whois search)\nAccording to its current website, Tingo claims to have sold 30 million mobile devices since inception. Its most recent investor presentation says the company has 12 million active mobile customers. [Pg. 7]\nTingo Claimed In Its Reverse Merger Press Release That 2 Unnamed Farming Cooperatives Supplied The Majority Of Its Then-9.3 Million Userbase, Consisting Of Local Farmers\nA Local Media Outlet Identified And Contacted The Cooperatives. Both Said They Had Never Heard of Tingo And Had Fewer Than 100 Farmers In Each Cooperative\nWe Were Able To Make Contact With One Of The Cooperatives. Its Owner Said It Has No Relationship With Tingo And Flat Out Told Us “They Are Scammers.”\nTingo said in an October 2022 press release that its userbase is largely derived through contractual relationships with “two large farmers’ cooperatives” which “facilitates the distribution of Tingo branded smartphones into various rural communities of member farmers”.\nIts recent 10-Q similarly reiterated its reliance on farming cooperatives for “each of our current subscribers”. [Pg. 27]\nGiven that Tingo’s farmer userbase is key to its entire business and the 2 cooperatives are key to its userbase, these are critical relationships.\nWhile the farmer’s cooperatives went unnamed in the company’s press release, an earlier article from local media outlet Weetracker (paywalled) was able to identify them.\nIn March 2022, Weetracker interviewed a Tingo spokesperson along with local experts to understand the company’s userbase claims, which totaled 12 million at the time. One local expert in Nigerian agriculture told the outlet:\n“I’ve been in this field for more than 20 years and I have built agric distribution chains from all the key farming geographies in the country for some of the biggest companies. Trust me, if any platform has as little as 1,000 farmers, I would know. Let alone 12 million farmers? No single private platform has up to 500,000 farmers in Nigeria at the moment”\nTingo’s chief of staff, Rory Bowen, responded by claiming that the farmers might simply not know they are using Tingo, because it works with farmer cooperatives and not with the farmers directly.\n“We don’t deal with farmers directly, that may be why they don’t know the brand. We have relationships with two main cooperatives: Kebbi Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society and Ailoje Royal Farms Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society. They help us reach 4-5 million farmers each.”\nIt is relatively unfathomable that millions of farmers using “Tingo-branded smartphones”, per the company’s annual report, would be unaware of Tingo. [Pg. 83] Putting that absurdity aside for the moment, Weetracker reached out to both cooperatives and found that neither had heard of Tingo. Per the same article:\n“WeeTracker reached out to the leaders of both cooperatives and, strangely, they claimed they had never heard of Tingo, nor did they have millions of farmers under their organization with each of them volunteering that they have much less than 100 farmers.”[10]\nThe leader of one of the cooperatives said:\n“It is simply not true, I don’t know anything about this company and I’ve been running this cooperative for years.”\nWe reached out to one of the cooperatives named in the piece, the Ailoje Royal Farms Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society. Its owner told us that Tingo are “scammers”.[11]\n(Pictured: Hindenburg investigator’s chat with owner of the Ailoje Royal Farms Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society)\nOur Checks With The Nigerian Communications Commission Show That It Has No Record Of Tingo Being A Mobile Licensee At All, Despite Company Claims To Have 12 Million Mobile Customers\nAdding more fuel to our skepticism, Tingo’s 30+ million claimed mobile sales come despite the Nigerian Communications Commission (“NCC”) having no record of Tingo as a licensee at all:\n(Source: Nigerian Communications Commission showing Tingo is not a licensee, either individually or as any class such as “sales & installation”)\nBeyond licensing, the NCC also requires operators to have their individual pricing plans approved. Tingo appears nowhere on these official lists either. [13]\n*Update Post-Publication*: Tingo Claims That It Offers Its Mobile Services Through A Mobile Virtual Network (“MNVO”) Agreement With Nigerian Telecom Operator Airtel\nAirtel Wrote Denying The Relationship Entirely: “Airtel Nigeria Does Not Have Any MVNO Arrangement With Any Company Called Tingo Mobile.”\nFor context, Tingo says in its filings that it has an agreement with Airtel to provide voice and data services under a Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNO”) arrangement:\n“Through a Mobile Virtual Network agreement with Airtel, Tingo Mobile provides its customers in Nigeria with voice and data services.” [Pg. 20][12]\nWe recently reached out to Airtel and corresponded with its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Nigeria, who said he would check on the existence and nature of the claimed partnership. Following the initial publication of our report, Airtel’s investor relations responded, denying it had a relationship with Tingo Mobile.\nTingo Mobile’s Corporate Presentation And Webpage Use Stock Photos Of Farmers Using Phones\nDespite claiming to have millions of farmers using its mobile devices, Tingo’s corporate presentation and webpage use stock photos of farmers with phones. Per a corporate presentation:\n(Source: Tingo’s May 15, 2023 investor presentation)\nThe same picture is available for free on Shutterstock with a description “young black African farmer checking interesting content on smart phone”.\nThe corporate presentation has another photo of African farmers that are meant to look like they are using Tingo phones:\n(Source: Tingo’s May 15, 2023 investor presentation [Pg. 5])\nBut once again, the photo can be found on Adobe Stock under the header “excited African couple doing internet banking on their farmland.”\nBeyond the apparent extensive use of stock photos for its website, Tingo Mobile shows few other signs of life. Its Facebook page has a mere 733 likes and 926 followers, not what one would expect for a provider that has more than 12 million users.\nSimilarly, Tingo Mobile’s Twitter page has 227 followers and hasn’t posted anything since October 2016. Its Instagram page has 515 followers.\nTingo Claims It Has Two “Sole Suppliers Of Mobile Phones”, With The Relationships In Place Since 2020 and 2022, Respectively\nDuring This Time Period, Tingo Announced A Massive 2.9 Million Handset Deal, In Addition To Its Sales And Servicing Of 9+ Million Mobile Customers\nDespite Millions Of Claimed Unit Sales, Representatives Of Both Suppliers Told Us Neither Has Provided Any Phones to Tingo: “We Do Not Provide Even A Single Unit To Them”\nOne Supplier Said Tingo Doesn’t Even Have A Contract, Despite Claims In Tingo’s SEC Filings That It Does\nTingo’s 2022 annual report says that “UGC Technologies Company Limited and Bullitt Mobile Limited are TGH Group’s sole suppliers of mobile phones at present.” [Pg. 10]\nPer the same filing, Tingo says the relationships have been in place since March 2020 and January 2022, respectively.\nBeyond its need to sell and service its claimed 9+ million mobile customers, it was during this time period that Tingo announced a major handset deal. Per its annual report:\n“…in Q4 2021 Tingo Mobile sold an additional 2.9 million handsets to a non-agricultural cooperative in Nigeria” [Pg. 8]\nWe therefore would expect the suppliers to have collectively sold millions of phones to Tingo. However, when we spoke with representatives from each, they told us that neither of the claimed suppliers had sold a single phone to Tingo.\nTingo’s filings state with respect to UGC:\n“In March 2020, Tingo Mobile entered into a mobile phone procurement contract with UGC Technologies Company Limited” [Pg. 10]\nWe spoke with UGC’s Troy, Michigan-based CEO, Busty Okendaye, who explained that UGC had no contract with Tingo. UGC had bid on a contract to provide phones to Tingo about 3 years ago, but after submitting its proposal, it never heard back:\n“They did not even reply to us – not even verbally or in writing. We submitted our own bid, but we did not get a response from them.”\nHe also expressly denied that UGC has sold any phones to Tingo, telling us:\n“We do not provide not even a single unit to them. We manufacture mobile phones, but we don’t produce for them.”\nTingo further states in its 2022 annual report that it entered into its second supply agreement in January 2022, this one with UK-based Bullitt Mobile. [Pg. 10] A representative for Bullitt confirmed that the company had signed a contract to provide phones in the future but has not provided any phones to date.\nWe Visited Tingo Mobile’s Office In Nigeria And Found A Sign Posted On Its Door By Federal Tax Authorities Stating That The Company Is Delinquent On Its Tax Obligations\nGiven the massive red flags, we decided to inspect the company’s physical locations as reported in its SEC filings. Per Tingo Group’s annual report, Tingo Mobile has 2 locations in Nigeria [Pg. 78]:\nAllianz Towers, 95 Broad Street Marina Lagos. 93 Dr Kenneth Ojo Crescent Lingo Estate Sahara 4, Lokogoma, FCT, Abuja\nOur investigator visited Allianz Towers during working hours in late May.\n(Pictured: Allianz office tower. Source: Hindenburg investigator)\nThere was no visible street-level signage, but our investigator found the Tingo office on the 4th floor of the building. It was lightly staffed with around 6-8 people. The office door had a conspicuous sign placed by the tax authorities highlighting that the company was not compliant with its federal tax obligations.\n(Pictured: Tingo Mobile office front door. Source: Hindenburg investigator)\nThe second location listed in Tingo’s filings tracks to an area that looks residential. The latest Google street view picture of the address is from October 2021, depicting a residential structure in development.\nTingo Mobile Claimed its Ghana Expansion Efforts Would Enroll 2-4 Million Members By February 2023. This Would Represent 9%-18% Market Share In The Country Within Months\nWe Found Zero Records Pertaining To Tingo Mobile Through Ghana’s Communication Regulator\nTingo claims to be copying its Nigeria playbook in Ghana– open an office, distribute phones, help farmers:\n“On November 10, 2022, Tingo Mobile opened a new regional head office in Ghana and launched operations there. In conjunction with the launch, Tingo Mobile also announced an agreement with the Ashanti Investment Trust, the investment arm of the Ashanti Kingdom, to enroll a minimum of 2 million new members in Ghana with Tingo Mobile within 120 days of signing and has agreed on a target to increase such enrollments to at least 4 million members.”[14] [Pg. 3]\nThe Company threw a launch event in November 2022, but it is unclear whether any of the new subscribers ever materialized within the 120 days (i.e., February 2023) as claimed.\nGhana’s Communications regulator – the National Communications Authority (NCA) – has zero records pertaining to Tingo Mobile – zero licenses and zero mentions on the website, just as was the case for Tingo and the Nigerian Communications Commission.\nThe NCA website says the nation at large has 22.76 million mobile data subscriptions as of January 2023. Tingo’s claims would suggest that it already took over ~9%-18% of the entire nation’s market share despite having no license to do so.\nWe Tried Contacting Tingo’s Ghana Support To Buy A Phone\nThe Email Bounced Back And No One Picked Up The Phone, Despite Numerous Attempts\nWe tried contacting Tingo Mobile in Ghana through the phone and email details on its website, to see how it might be growing so rapidly.\n(Source: Tingo Mobile Ghana website)\nThe phone number appears to be defunct, as we called at various times without an answer. The email address also appears invalid, as it bounced back when we tried to reach out.\nWe Visited Tingo’s Ghana Office Location In Late May 2023\nWe Saw 2 Cars In The Parking Lot And No Customers. When We Tried To Buy A Plan Or A Phone We Were Told The Location Wasn’t Operational Yet\nAs a last-ditch effort to buy a Tingo Mobile Ghana phone, we visited its office location on May 25th, 2023 during working hours. Our investigator reported seeing only two cars in the parking lot. There were no customers in the store and when they tried to buy a plan or a phone an employee told them the location wasn’t operational yet.\n(Tingo Mobile Ghana building and parking lot during working hours. Source: Hindenburg investigator)\nTingoPay (Part Of Tingo Mobile) Claimed In 2021 To Have Launched A Partnership With A Major Local Bank\n2 Days After Tingo’s Blockbuster Announcement, The Bank Issued A Statement Calling Tingo’s Claim False And That It Had “NOT Concluded Any Agreement With Tingo International In Respect Of Any Payment System Whatsoever”\nTingo has made other questionable claims relating to its mobile division. On March 31st, 2021, Tingo announced it was expanding its mobile services by launching “Tingo Pay” through a partnership with Stanbic IBTC Bank.\nTwo days after Tingo’s announcement, the bank issued a statement declaring Tingo’s announcement to be false.\n(Source: Stanbic bank website)\nStanbic said that while it had a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Tingo, it clarified:\n“(Stanbic) has NOT concluded any agreement with Tingo International in respect of any payment system whatsoever, including ‘Tingo Pay’.”\nTingo Now Claims Its Payment Group Has Point Of Sale (PoS) And Other Merchant Products\nWe Found That Pictures of Tingo’s Claimed PoS System Were Taken From A Different PoS Operator’s Website, With A Tingo Logo Photoshopped Over Them\nIn its latest filings, Tingo claims it relaunched TingoPay as a new “Super App” in 2023 in partnership with Visa. [Pg. 9] We reached out to Visa to learn more but have yet to hear back on the relationship. We could find no links, or evidence of a new TingoPay app in the GooglePlay or Apple stores.[15]\nPer its website, Tingo Mobile now offers a TingoPay POS system, presumably as part of its partnership. The website has 2 pictures of the system.\nThe first image appears to have been lifted from hardware offered by an Indian payments company called PoketPOS, that launched a PoS device around 3 years ago, before Tingo’s claimed offering. Tingo seems to have simply photoshopped its own logo onto the picture of the competitor’s product. Here is Tingo’s website:\nAnd here is the competitor’s website, showing a picture of identical PoS hardware without the Tingo logo from 3 years prior:\nThe second TingoPay PoS picture from the company’s website is seen below:\n(Source Tingo Mobile website)\nOnce again, it appears to be a ripoff of a picture from a Chinese manufacturer with the Tingo logo photoshopped onto the picture of the hardware. The Chinese manufacturer also launched its product around 3 years ago, before Tingo’s claimed offering:\nPart IV: Tingo’s “NWASSA” Market\nNWASSA: A “Seed to Sale” Online Marketplace That Tingo Claimed Generated $125.3 Million In Revenue Last Quarter (Or ~15% Of Total)\nThe Website Has Been “Under Maintenance” And Inoperable For Months\nTingo claims that its NWASSA platform is a groundbreaking innovation that cuts out middlemen by allowing farmers to sell products wholesale or retail directly in their home marketplaces. The company calls it “Africa’s leading digital agriculture ecosystem”. [Pg. 3]\nLast quarter, Tingo reported $125.3 million in revenue through NWASSA, putting it on track for $501 million in annual revenue. [Pg. 15]\nThe company has been inconsistent about when it supposedly launched NWASSA. In an interview with Techpoint in 2019, Dozy said he launched the NWASSA platform in January 2019. In an investor results conference call from March 2023, the story changed, with Dozy claiming it was launched in 2020.\nPutting aside the mystery of when the platform was launched, the company has declared it to be a huge success. As early as July 2021 it claimed NWASSA platform “processes 500k daily transactions with a value of over $8 million”, implying ~180 million annual transactions.\nThe company has indicated that its explosive NWASSA business was taking place via a “USSD GSM transaction platform” a system of text messaging orders (i.e., “Press 2 to order rice”). We could find no evidence in media, company filings, or the company’s website that such a system exists aside from Dozy’s claims that 15 million transactions per month are processed in this way. [Pg. 10, Pgs. 20-21]\nCuriously, DNS records for the NWASSA web domain show it was registered in May 2022, 2-3 years after the claimed launch date of the platform (depending on which launch date you pick).\n(Source: GoDaddy Whois search)\nGiven its ample reported revenue, we expected the NWASSA webpage to have detailed information on its text message ordering system, along with a bustling online marketplace.\nBut our recent efforts to access the platform showed only that the website has been “under maintenance” for months, providing no information and no ability to shop.\n(Source: NWASSA website accessed multiple times over the course of months)\nHistorical Captures Of The NWASSA Website Show That It Was Never Fully Completed\nThe Website Still Included Test Images. None Of The Products Had Reviews Or Ratings\nHistorical archives of the website from January of this year show that the now “under maintenance” site was never fully developed. It listed its first product as “test”.\n(Pictured: Historical capture of NWASSA Market from January 2023. Source: Wayback Machine)\nNone of the products we saw had any reviews or ratings. We saw no information on how to order through any USSD GSM text messaging system either.\nTingo Claims It Launched Its NWASSA Platform In Ghana In November 2022\nThe Ghana Website Also Doesn’t Work, And Just Says “Updating…” Without Ever Going Anywhere\nHistorical Captures Of The Webpage Show That None Of The Products Had Reviews Or Ratings\nWith its claimed success in Nigeria, Tingo decided to take its show on the road, launching its NWASSA market in Ghana around November 2022, saying it would replicate “the same proven business model” from Nigeria.\nOn some level those efforts have come to fruition as the Ghana website also fails to load, simply saying it is “Updating…” without going anywhere.\n(Pictured: NWASSA Market Ghana homepage accessed late May to early June 2023, which says it is “Updating…”)\nScreen captures from earlier versions of the Ghana website show that at various times the company did offer products, again with no reviews and no sign of actual sales.\nIn one instance, the company offered a bag of “Ting Rice” of unspecified quantity for the equivalent of about U.S. $2,500. Ghana’s GDP per capita is about U.S. $2,400. Note that the picture of the rice was that of a bag marked “Tingo Beans”.\n(Source: Tingo NWASSA Ghana market screenshot, from when the website “worked” and was selling $2,500 bags of rice labeled as beans)\nPart V: Tingo DMCC\nIn A May 2023 Press Release, Tingo Claimed Its Agricultural Export Business, Tingo DMCC, Was On Track To Deliver Over U.S. $1.34 Billion In Exports By Q3\nTingo’s Sales Projections Are Higher Than The Entire Nation Of Nigeria’s Annual 2022 Agriculture Exports, Which Totaled About U.S. $1.15 Billion, Per Government Data\nOn May 30th, 2023, Tingo announced yet another exciting development and milestone. Per the release, Tingo claimed it had completed $348 million in export sales through its new subsidiary, Tingo DMCC, a commodity trading platform based out of Dubai. [Pg. 3]\nThe same release claimed it expected to complete an additional $1 billion in orders by Q3, for a total of $1.34 billion and an annual run rate of $1.78 billion.\nPutting this figure in perspective, the 2022 annual agricultural exports for the entire country of Nigeria totaled about U.S. $1.15 billion,[16] according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Tingo therefore claims to be on track to eclipse the amount of the entire country’s exports within 9 months.\nAs a reminder, Tingo does not produce, harvest or process any agricultural goods on its own. The company does not claim to own warehouses or trucks used for Tingo DMCC. Instead, it claims to act as a middleman in these transactions—between the Nigerian farmers, farm collectives and unnamed export partners.\nNote that Tingo claimed its gross profit on $348 million in food exports for which it is totally a middleman is “approaching $100 million”, or about 29%, which, if genuine, would likely place Tingo as the most profitable food export business in the world.\nWe Found No Import/Export Records From Tingo At All Through Searches Of Nigerian Customs Databases\nA search of Nigerian customs data provided through import / export aggregator Tradesparq yielded no results when searched for keywords “Tingo”, “Tingo DMCC”, “Tingo group”, “Tingo Mobile” and “Tingo Foods”.\nThe Tradeparq customs data covered the periods January 2019 to April 2023 for imports, and January 2021 to April 2023 for exports. A search for competitor “Nestle” yielded over 2,000 export entries alone.\nSimilarly, utilizing ImportGenius, we were also unable to find any import-export record from Tingo or any of its subsidiaries or trade partners.\nNeedless to say, this is a massive red flag indicating that Tingo’s claimed exports may be a total fabrication.\nTingo DMCC’s Website Has Numerous Non-Functioning Links And Includes A Fake Testimonial That Appears Leftover From The Website Template\nTingo’s DMCC website was newly registered in 2022. It appears to have no live trading and no ability to set up an active trading account. All links go to prices on external website www.TradingView.com. The website has numerous non-functioning links and circular references that redirect back to the main home page.\nThe website includes a fake testimonial that appears leftover from the website template. The same “Gabriel Denis” in Tingo’s testimonial is mentioned in multiple other websites that share the same format. [1,2,3]\n(Source: www.tingodmcc.com showing a testimonial from “Gabriel Denis”)\n(Other testimonials from “Gabriel Denis” from other websites using a similar template, [1, 2])\nPart VI: Tingo’s Financials Seem Completely Fabricated\nGiven Tingo’s irregularities, with no signs of genuine customers, products, facilities, or really much of anything at all except bad photoshopping skills, one might wonder about the company’s glowing reported financials.\nAs a reminder, the company has a claimed cash balance of $780 million, and quarterly revenue and net income of $851 million and $177 million, respectively. [Pgs. 1, 3]\nTingo Financial Statements Are Riddled With Errors And Typos, Including A Note To Itself That It Apparently Forgot To Delete: “Please Update For The Tingle (sic) Transaction”\nIn what might be considered foreshadowing, Tingo’s annual report filed with the SEC includes a note to itself, with its own company name spelled wrong, that it forgot to delete. The report’s related party transactions note implores someone to “Please update for the tingle transaction including the tingle foods transaction.”\n(Source: Tingo’s Annual report filed with the SEC. [Pg. 106])\nThe section as reported didn’t end up including the Tingo Foods (or “tingle foods”) transaction.\nIn another instance, Tingo Mobile, the “Comprehensive Platform Service” segment, claimed $253.466 million in revenues in Q1 2023:\n(Source: Tingo Q1 2023 10-Q [Pg. 29])\nThe explanatory note to these results then says the following:\n“Gross profit related to the Comprehensive Platform Service segment for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was $156,010,000 representing a gross margin of 24%.” [Pg. 30]\nWhile the note says the gross margin was 24%, math would suggest that the gross margin is actually 61.55% (i.e., $156.01 million in gross profits divided by $253.466 million in revenues.)\nSimilarly (shown below), the company seemingly forgot to add 3 zeroes to its cost of revenues for its Food Processing segment. We suspect it meant to report $348,896,000 (versus $348,896, which would give the segment an impressive 99.94% gross margin):\n(Source: Tingo Q1 2023 10-Q [Pg. 30])\nMore Troublingly, Tingo’s Cash Flow And Balance Sheet Statements In Both Its Audited Annual And Unaudited Quarterly Filings Appear To Have Glaring Issues\nBeyond typos and other errors in notes, the company’s core financial statements also exhibit major irregularities.\nThe company seems to get its signs/directions confused. For example, with every other company we are aware of, a reduction in accounts receivable is considered a source in cash, given that the it means the accounts were paid.\nContrary to this, Tingo’s financial professionals seem to think that a $150 million reduction in accounts receivables somehow drains the company of cash, per its latest quarterly report.\n(Source: Tingo Q1 2023 10-Q [Pg. 6])\nThe issue goes beyond its cash flow statements. Despite Tingo’s cash flow statement reporting that receivables decreased by $150.1 million, Tingo’s balance sheet in the same period reported that receivables increased by $345.2 million.\n(Source: Tingo’s Q1 2023 balance sheet [Pg. 1])\nWe couldn’t find any explanation for the $495.3 million accounts receivable discrepancy and suspect neither the trade receivables or cash balances are real.[17]\nThe issue is not just isolated to Tingo’s unaudited quarterly report. Its annual report, which was audited and given a clean audit opinion, seems to suffer from the same issues. [Pg. F-11] It’s balance sheet shows a $6.3 million annual reduction in trade receivables while its cash flow statement shows an increase of $7.7 million in the same line item. [Pgs. F-6, F-11]) The annual report also includes the supposed accounts receivable increase as a source of cash in its cash flow statements, again mixing up the signs.\nNote that the above is just a sampling of the issues. We identified similar issues with accounts payable, deferred taxes, current liabilities and PP&E.\nIn short, Tingo seems to have little financial controls whatsoever and its auditor seems to have completely missed it.\nWe Strongly Suspect Tingo’s Cash Balance, Which It Conveniently Claims Is Held In Nigeria, Is Fake\nThe Company Collected Only ~12% Of The Interest Income One Would Expect From Its Claimed Cash Balances\nTingo claimed to have $780 million in cash as of Q1 2023. [Pg. 1] Per the same financials:\n“The majority of the cash is held at its bank in Nigeria, and there are certain foreign exchange restrictions in place that limit the conversion of such cash into US Dollars” [Pg. 31]\nDespite its claims, Tingo has received far less interest on its cash than one would expect.\nInterest rates on Nigerian deposits are around 8%. Tingo supposedly had $500 million in cash at year-end 2022 and $780 million at the end of Q1. If we conservatively assume a $600 million average cash balance, Tingo should have received about $12 million in interest income for the quarter. However, the company reported just $1.4 million. [Pg. 31]\nTingo’s Auditor Is An Israeli Firm That’s Part Of The Deloitte Global Network\nIt Gave Tingo A Clean Audit Opinion For 2022 Despite What We View As Glaring, Obvious Anomalies That Even Basic Auditing Checks Would Have Spotted From A Mile Away\nThe issues in Tingo’s financials are glaring enough that we’d expect they could have been spotted by any semi-conscious finance undergrad with severe vision loss.\nThese issues were apparently not glaring enough for the company’s auditor, however.\nIn October 2022, Tingo’s auditor, Friedman LLP resigned. [Pg. 94] In Friedman’s place stepped Brightman Almagor Zohar & Co., a firm in the Deloitte global network. The Israeli-based audit office is an odd choice given that Tingo has no signs of substantive operations in Israel. In its 2022 audit, “Deloitte Israel” gave Tingo an unqualified audit opinion. [Pg. F-3]\nFor 2022, Tingo disclosed that it paid over $1.5 million to its auditors for audit related fees including its annual audit and reviews of quarterly reports. [Pg. 106]\nGiven the obvious errors, we suspect Deloitte Israel missed or rushed through procedures that would have uncovered important findings. Deloitte is a big-4 firm with a reputation worthy of protecting. We hope it chooses to do so.\nConclusion: We Think Tingo Is A Brazen Fraud That Should Serve As A Humiliating Embarrassment For All Involved\nTingo is a word in the Pascuense language of Easter Island meaning, “to borrow objects from a friend’s house, one by one, until there’s nothing left.”\nFor a company that did an otherwise terrible job trying to pretend to be a real business, it landed on an absolutely perfect name.\nWe expect Tingo will not be long for this world—another cautionary tale.\nDisclosure: We Are Short Shares of Tingo Group, Inc.

Dozy’s full name is Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye. Note that Darren Mercer is the Group CEO of Tingo, while Dozy is CEO of its key holding company entity.\n[3] For reference, we checked Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye, Mmobuosi Odogwu and even attempted his nickname, Dozy Odogwu.\n[4] Despite the very public resignation, Tingo still lists Charlier as Co-Chairman on its website as of this writing.\n[5] Tingo claims within the exact same filing that its Tingo Foods division “commenced food processing operations in August 2022” and that it “commenced food processing operations in September 2022”. [Pgs. 8, 22] Obviously both of these cannot be true. (We suspect neither of them are.)\n[6] To replicate this, right click on the ArtStation webpage, navigate to “inspect”. From there readers can “Command+F” to find the origin of the picture, listed as October 28, 2018\n[7] Note that Evtec Energy lists David Roberts as principal, who signed the agreement with Tingo alongside Dozy. We found no evidence of Robert’s experience building solar energy facilities, but plenty of experience in reverse mergers of companies in ‘hot’ sectors like electric vehicles and cannabis [1,2] along with other projects like building a nuclear reactor, which it aims to complete “by early 2030s”.\n[8] Another anomaly in the Tingo Foods Plc statements is the disclosure that the company has just 3 customers: Customer A, Customer B, and Customer C which together constitute 100% of revenues. None of these customers are disclosed. It is unclear how a company has just 3 customers if it is supposedly providing “seed to sale” services for millions of farmers.\n[9] The Company’s DEF 14A filed with the SEC on May 1, 2023 makes mention of inventory, but provides no clear explanation as to how the accounting line items disappeared from the financial statements entirely: “During March 2023, Tingo Foods…moved to a just-in-time inventory management system, in parallel to agreeing to a direct-to-customer shipping arrangement with its produce and processing suppliers, in connection with which it aims to avoid holding physical inventory.” [Pg. F-96]\n[10] Note that in Tingo’s 10-K filed with the SEC it claimed that “in Q4 2021 Tingo Mobile sold an additional 2.9 million handsets to a non-agricultural cooperative in Nigeria”. [Pg. 8] Again, each cooperative had fewer than 100 farmers.\n[11] Note also that the Facebook page for the small co-op says it has only 100 hectares of farmland. Were Tingo’s claims of 4-5 million farmers for the co-op true, it suggests that each farmer would only have 2.1-2.6 sq ft of land to grow crops each—perhaps enough for a handful of carrots and potatoes, but unlikely to drive the massive revenue and operating income metrics claimed by the company. (Unless they’re really, really delicious carrots.)\n[12] MVNO licenses are a new development that come with a strict set of requirements around technical capabilities and financial condition. As of June, 2023, the licenses are just beginning to be approved. Thus it is not possible that Tingo Mobile had this license at any time in the past, and it does not show up as a current licensee.\n[13] The NCC also reports numbering by carrier, a list Tingo also doesn’t show up on. Lastly, the NCC website breaks down the top mobile carriers, which include all the major local carriers like Airtel, 9mobile, Globacom, MTN and Visafone. Tingo again appears nowhere on any of the lists.\n[14] Tingo claims to be partnering with the Ashanti Kingdom Investment Trust (“AKIT”) of the Ashanti Kingdom for the Ghana operation expansion. AKIT is run by “His Royal Highness Oheneba Yaw Otchere” who previously advised and partnered on a failed crypto project called Kamari / Kampay together with Tingo President Chris Cleverly. This would suggest that Otchere may either be a useful pawn of Cleverly and in this case Tingo, or that he’s willingly ‘in on it’. The shitcoin associated with the Kampay project initially spiked to around $7 then plummeted to $0.0038. Nothing ever came of the project or KamPay’s promises to revitalize Africa, that we can find.\n[15] We found an older TingoPay app in the GooglePlay store with only around 10,000+ downloads.\n[16] The data from the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics shows that 528 billion (Nigerian Naira) worth of agricultural products were exported in 2022. The exchange rate of the Naira to USD was 0.002169 USD to 1 Naira on May 30, 2023, the time of the Tingo announcement.\n[17] One possibility we examined was whether the discrepancy had to do with Tingo’s acquisition of Tingo Foods in February 2023, but Tingo disclosed a minimal $14.7 million change to net working capital, and only a $56.8 million total impact to cash.

    "maintext": "Twitch just revealed its plans to implement new branded content guidelines. However, this news hasn’t gone down well in the streaming community. From a breakdown of the proposed changes to a recap of the backlash, here’s everything you need to get caught up.\nSponsored streams are a key source of revenue when it comes to content creation. Whether it’s a budding streamer looking to carve out a living or an established partner raking in the big bucks, outside of donations and subscriptions, sponsors are perhaps the biggest source of income.\nArticle continues after ad\nThus, when changes are announced for said sponsored streams, the impact is far-reaching across the entire platform. Those ripples were felt on June 6 when Twitch detailed its latest adjustments for what constitutes viable branded content.\nSweeping policy changes and new restrictions alike led to a colossal wave of backwash mere hours after news hit the web. So if you’re looking to get caught up on not only the new rules but the surrounding controversy too, we’ve got you covered with a full rundown below.\nArticle continues after ad\nContents\nTwitch Twitch’s own ads are still allowed everywhere, but it may soon be harder for streamers to advertise sponsors in paid brand deals.\nTwitch’s new branded content guidelines explained\nAs defined by Twitch itself, branded content relates to “any content produced by streamers featuring products or services based on an exchange of value.” In layman’s terms, any streamers being paid to promote something fall under this umbrella.\nWhether it’s playing a newly released video game as part of a deal, drinking a sponsored energy drink on stream, or advertising a clothing line, for instance, it’s all branded content at the end of the day.\nArticle continues after ad\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that Twitch, the Amazon-owned streaming platform, holds the cards. “We recognize that streamers want to collaborate with brands, but as outlined in the Terms of Service, we maintain the exclusive right to sell, serve, and display advertisements on the Twitch Services,” a chunk of the new policy states.\nAs a result, Twitch is looking to clamp down on how this branded content is presented on the platform. Namely, through new restrictions, certain types of branded content is no longer allowed, while new guidelines enforce a stricter appearance for permitted content of this nature.\nArticle continues after ad\nWhat is allowed under new branded content guidelines on Twitch\nProducts and services deemed unharmful are still permitted for sponsored streams on Twitch. However, the means in which content creators can integrate them are changing.\nHere’s a look at what’s still allowed on Twitch when it comes to branded content:\nBranded panels on your Channel Page\nShowcasing products in your stream background\nIncluding links (in your chat) to other sites that promote things\nDiscussing, endorsing, or unboxing products or services\nPlaying sponsored games\nTwitch\nWhat isn’t allowed under new branded content guidelines on Twitch\nMoving forward, should these new guidelines remain intact, streamers will no longer be permitted the freedoms they once were when it comes to branded content. From specifics like the exact size of sponsored logos on streams, to broader restrictions like banner ads or pre-recorded video ads now banned on Twitch, there’s plenty to wrap your head around.\nArticle continues after ad\nHere’s a look at what’s no longer allowed on Twitch in light of its new branded content guidelines:\nLogos on stream: On-stream brand overlays are limited to 3% of screen size\nOn-stream brand overlays are limited to 3% of screen size Inserted ‘burned in’ video ads: Streamers may not insert video ads directly into their streams\nStreamers may not insert video ads directly into their streams Inserted ‘burned in’ display ads: Streamers may not insert display or ‘banner’ ads directly into their streams\nStreamers may not insert display or ‘banner’ ads directly into their streams Inserted ‘burned in’ audio ads: Streamers may not insert audio ads directly into their streams\nTwitch\nFurthermore, certain types of branded content is also restricted under the new guidelines. As you would expect, anything outright illegal, hateful, or deemed as malicious, can’t be promoted on Twitch. This also extends to the likes of political content, adult-oriented products or services, and even financial products and services too.\nIf streamers are uncertain on whether a proposed brand deal aligns with these new restrictions, Twitch encourages them to check the Branded Content Discloser Tool in the Stream Manager.\nArticle continues after ad\nRamifications of new branded content guidelines on Twitch\nGiven the significance of these new guidelines, the impact can be felt by content creators at all levels. For the average streamer on Twitch, perhaps the most important aspect here is the new on-stream limitations.\nNo longer can a typical Twitch streamer accept an ordinary brand deal with the usual slate of on-stream assets. With burned in videos and even banners now barred from the platform, all that can be featured is a simple logo to promote the sponsor. Yet even that logo is now restricted and can’t exceed 3% of your total screen size.\nArticle continues after ad\nIn particular, these guidelines could severely impact charitable streams. In the past, charity-driven content often features key advertising marks on stream. Whether it’s banners updating fans on total donations or even full-screen promotions at certain intervals, charity streams often rely on these measures to convey key information to the audience.\nSimilarly, Twitch’s new guidelines also impose major restrictions on esports broadcasts. Given esports is still a completely free-to-watch form of entertainment, publishers and event organizers typically rely on sponsor revenue to stay afloat. That can appear in the form of video ads, audio ad reads on air, and of course, branded logos across the board. Exactly how esports organizations can expect to turn a profit under these restrictions is yet unclear.\nArticle continues after ad\nOverwatch League Esports broadcasts, in particular, heavily depend on branded content to generate revenue.\nFrom another angle, the branded content guidelines also impact disabled streamers. One key example raised by blind content creator Steve Saylor relates to the new logo sizing parameters. “The 3% logo size rule isn’t accessible for low vision users as it is too small for overlays and even smaller on mobile,” they explained.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Email Sign up\nTwitch streamers protest branded content guidelines\nAs you would have likely put together by now, Twitch’s newly revealed guidelines haven’t exactly been met with much fanfare. Quite the opposite as countless Twitch streamers have lashed out at the proposed changes, with some even threatening to leave the platform altogether.\nArticle continues after ad\nAmong the first to protest was Twitch superstar Asmongold. As one of the biggest personalities on the site today, he spoke out against the new policies and even pushed for other streamers to “consider boycotting Twitch or moving to other platforms.\n“Making common and harmless forms of advertisement literally against Terms of Service so Twitch can monopolize more of streamers’ income.”\nGiven Asmon is a co-founder of streaming group OTK, it was only right the mega-popular team followed suit with its own response next. In a lengthy “message to Twitch” hours after news broke, OTK fought back against the platform’s “anti-creator” policies.\nArticle continues after ad\n“Small streamers who rely on their once-a-month Hello Fresh sponsorship cannot pay their bills under these new guidelines,” the statement put bluntly.\nFurthermore, fellow co-founder Tips Out shared his own statement on Twitter, adding that if Twitch follows through with its proposed changes, “OTK network will be leaving Twitch. This is a direct attack on our business, staff, and all of the hard work we have put into our organization.”\nIt wasn’t long before more content creators joined the conversation, with former Twitch icon turned YouTube-exclusive streamer Ludwig chiming in next. “Twitch suffers from having no relationship built with their viewers/streamers,” he claimed.\nArticle continues after ad\n“It’s always a carefully crafted impersonal article. And based on all their recent actions, viewers have no choice but to interpret everything in the least charitable way.”\nMoistCr1tikal then followed up with harsh words of his own, arguing that Twitch is “completely lost as a platform,” even going on to bash the “geriatric policy decision.”\nThe overwhelming backlash even caught the attention of MrBeast. “I’m not even a Twitch streamer and now I want to stream on a competitor just to spite them for you guys,” he said. “If YouTube pulled this sh*t, I’d lose my mind.”\nArticle continues after ad\nTwitch apologizes amid backlash to new guidelines\nGiven the all but unanimous uproar, Twitch eventually issued a brief apology on Twitter. Hours after the branded content guidelines were made clear, the platform claimed its proposed changes were “overly broad.\n“This created confusion and frustration, and we apologize for that. We do not intend to limit streamers’ ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors, and we understand that this is an important part of how streamers earn revenue.\n“We missed the mark with the policy language and will rewrite the guidelines to be clearer. Thank you for sharing your concerns, and we appreciate the feedback. We’ll notify the community once we have updated the language.”\nArticle continues after ad\nSo what happens next?\nFrom here, the ball is now in the court of Twitch. Content creators across the board have clearly expressed their displeasure with the proposed changes. The onus is now on Twitch to appropriately address the feedback.\nThus far, it seems ‘updating the language’ of its guidelines is Twitch’s top priority. So we should expect a clarified rundown in the coming days. Though whether or not key policies will change in light of the backlash, remains unclear.\nArticle continues after ad\nAs a result of Twitch seemingly sticking to its guns, many streamers are now considering alternatives in order to continue generating a stable income. However, for any affiliated Twitch streamers looking to jump ship, there’s a $25 fee to be paid upon breaking the agreement.\nPledging to support those in need, rival platform Kick has offered to pay this $25 sum for any Twitch streamers that jump ship to the newer streaming site.\nWe’ll have to wait and see how things play out from here as the backlash continues to mount. Rest assured, we’ll keep you up to speed right here with all the latest as any further details emerge.",

Serial production starts next year, the plant plans to assemble up to 410 cars daily.\nSkoda Kodiaq second generation will receive versions with petrol and diesel engines, as well as a plug-in hybrid version (for the first time in the history of the series).\nTogether with the Skoda Kodiaq, a new generation Skoda Superb will be presented this fall, which will also be launched into mass production in early 2024.\nThe automaker also confirmed that the next-generation Superb is moving to Bratislava in early 2024, freeing up capacity for around 150,000 additional Kodiaqs and Karoqs annually in Kvasiny.",

    "maintext": "Last summer, it emerged that the RAF, desperate to hit diversity targets for new recruits, had proposed outright stopping the recruitment of white male applicants. This prompted the then head of recruitment, Group Captain Elizabeth Nicholl, to resign in protest.\nThe story has rumbled on since then, with a succession of leaks and revelations illustrating the depths which the RAF was willing to plumb in order to meet its targets. Senior RAF personnel confirmed that recruitment was “slowed” when it became clear the service was missing its targets. Leaked emails have shown RAF staff complaining about “useless white male pilots”. It’s been reported that 31 white men have received payouts from the RAF after being disadvantaged by its recruitment policy.\nWhen the story first broke, defence minister James Heappey was on hand to reassure us that we’re all trying to find the guy who did this. “If there is evidence of positive discrimination,” he said, “the people responsible for that will be held vigorously to account.”\nPositive discrimination, of course, is technically unlawful in this country. You’re not supposed to be able to, say, set hiring quotas than discriminate for or against certain groups in order to improve your organisation’s diversity statistics. The Government’s own website says as much.\nThe prohibition on positive discrimination is riddled with loopholes\nThe problem is that the prohibition on positive discrimination in the Equality Act (2010) is weak and riddled with loopholes, some by omission and some explicitly written into the Act.\nThe RAF’s diversity targets are an example of the first type of loophole. There’s just nothing banning them. More to the point, as the RAF itself has pointed out when triumphantly announcing that it’s achieved its targets in the past, the Government itself is setting the targets.\nIt’s not just the RAF, and it’s not just the Government. Diversity targets are rife in the public sector. The Met Police wants 50 per cent of new recruits to be female. The BBC previously wanted 15 per cent of staff to be non-white, but then it achieved that, so it changed the target to 20 per cent — which is a higher proportion than the country as a whole.\nTo be fair, it’s not just the public sector. Sky also wants its workforce to be five per cent black and 20 per cent non-white by 2025.\nYou might wonder how these targets are different from unlawful hiring quotas, and it’s a fair question. Targets for new hires, like the RAF’s and the Met’s, are very similar to hiring quotas. Targets for the overall workforce, like the BBC’s and Sky’s, imply a target for new hires — once you take into account office turnover and how quickly you want to reach your target.\nThe difference, in theory, is that targets aren’t binding. The RAF case lays bare how seriously these targets can be taken in practice, however, considering the pressure that can be put on recruiters to meet them. Given that we only know about the situation at the RAF because of leaks, investigative journalism and Group Captain Nicholl’s principled stand, it’s hard not to believe that the RAF case is the tip of the iceberg.\nThe more explicit loopholes in the Equality Act fall under the banner of “positive action”. This ranges from relatively innocuous outreach programmes, to outright discriminatory paid opportunities that pass the legal test because they’re technically not jobs.\nFor example, the Tory MP Neil O’Brien recently criticised a TfL internship that, quite literally, bans white applicants. The scheme is open to graduates, runs for 11 months and pays a “bursary” of almost £22,000 — but because it’s technically an internship rather than, say, a graduate scheme, it comes under the umbrella of “positive action”.\nWhy are these loopholes so especially beloved by the public sector? Because the Government incentivises them. Public sector organisations are required by regulations to regularly publish reports on what they are doing to comply with the “public sector equality duty”, another feature of the Equality Act. The Equality and Human Rights Commission openly recommends that public sector employers consider using “positive action” to help them demonstrate compliance with the duty.\nSelection on merit is morally right, and it works\nThe RAF case neatly exposes how current law and policy are allowing and even encouraging organisations to move away from selection on merit. It also exposes the dangers of this move.\nIt’s obviously essential for national security that the best personnel are hired for the air force, irrespective of background, and that recruitment isn’t slowed down in order to massage statistics. That’s true at the best of times, let alone when senior politicians in nuclear-armed states are calling us their “eternal enemy” and declaring Government ministers “legitimate military targets”.\nThe stakes might not always be as high as the defence of the realm, but the same principle applies across the economy: selection on merit is morally right, it’s common sense and it works.\nSelection on merit is also a basic Conservative principle. O’Brien was right to call out the TfL scheme. Rishi Sunak was right to respond to the RAF case last summer by saying, “the only thing that should matter in recruitment is the content of your character, not your sex or the colour of your skin.”\nThe Government they run should go beyond words, though. It should take action to strengthen the Equality Act’s safeguards against positive discrimination and reassert the principle of selection on merit.\nThe Act should be amended to explicitly prohibit hiring quotas, including non-binding targets. “Positive action” should be restricted to genuine outreach work aimed at widening the pool of applicants. It specifically should not allow paid roles such as internships to run on a discriminatory basis. The public sector equality duty could also be scrapped, placing public sector organisations under the same set of equality rules as the private sector.\nThe Equality Act was rushed in by New Labour during their final days in office, and it purported to ban positive discrimination. The RAF case shows how, thirteen years on, the Act needs updating to close the loopholes that allow positive discrimination to persist in all but name.",

    "maintext": "Recaro knows that even little tweaks to plane seats can make a major difference.\nThe industry titan just unveiled a number of small but significant innovations at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany. It also had a couple of futuristic concepts on display at this week’s expo that point to the future of aircraft design.\nFirst and foremost, the German outfit presented a new premium seat called the PL3810 that promises to elevate the in-flight experience for top-tier passengers. Developed after comprehensive market and observational research, the newcomer has a number of amenities and ergonomic features that make it suited to the premium class in widebody aircraft.\nPassengers will enjoy a single-plate table, a 4.5-inch center armrest, a six-way adjustable headrest, a nine-inch recline with articulation, and a calf rest. Arguably the best touch is the “privacy wings,” which Recaro says help fliers “own their space.” The seat also weighs 10 percent less than its predecessors. As a result, it will give airlines more cabin flexibility and lower fuel costs.\nRecaro also presented the eco-friendly “R Sphere” seat concept, which was created with lightweight and recyclable materials, such as cork, wood, fishing nets, and cactus. Another highlight was the ultra-connected “R Horizon” concept, which is essentially a business seat with integrated smart cabin technology.\nThe newest version of the Sprint seat was also on display at the expo. The bestselling design has only an eight-week turnaround period between order and delivery. As a result, it has generated significant interest from major airlines.\n“With each seat order we receive, from economy to business class, Recaro is tasked with helping airlines build a better passenger experience,” CEO of Recaro Mark Hiller said in a statement. “AIX is an important part of that process, as we greatly value the feedback on our seats that we receive from our partners, customers, and suppliers.”\nThe company says it will use the feedback that it receives at AIX to make future seats even better.",

    "maintext": "As a Python programmer, you might be looking to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into your projects – anything from text generators to trading algorithms. That’s where this comprehensive LangChain Python guide comes in, tailored to fit both novices and seasoned coders.\nUnlike dense official documents or confusing tutorials, I bring a simplified approach to this tutorial, drawing from years of experience in making complex concepts more digestible. With easy-to-follow instructions and lucid examples, I’ll guide you through the intricate world of LangChain, unlocking its immense potential.\nDon’t delay; start leveraging LangChain to build innovative applications today.\nWhat Is LangChain?\nLangChain is a software development framework that makes it easier to create applications using large language models (LLMs). It’s an open-source tool with a Python and JavaScript codebase. LangChain allows developers to combine LLMs like GPT-4 with external data, opening up possibilities for various applications such as chatbots, code understanding, summarization, and more.\nLangChain Pros and Cons\nPros:\nFreely available\nOpen source\nSupports all major LLMs\nVariety of modules to perform common tasks\nCons:\nLimited support for languages other than Python\nSome people express security concerns over the handling of sensitive information.\nLangChain Pricing\nLangChain framework is a free-to-use open-source framework. To use some of the LangChain-supported large language models, you must subscribe to the developers of these models and obtain API keys.\nGetting Started with LangChain\nGetting started with the LangChain framework is straightforward. You can download the LangChain Python package, import one or more of the LangChain modules, and start building Python applications using large language models.\nInstallation\nYou can install the LangChain package via the following pip command.\n!pip install langchain\nAlternatively, if you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can install LangChain via the following conda command.\n!conda install langchain -c conda-forge\nA Simple Example\nLangChain simplifies the use of large language models by offering modules that cover different functions. Later on, I’ll provide detailed explanations of each module. In this section, let’s call a large language model for text generation. The general principle for calling different modules remains consistent throughout.\nYou must perform the following steps to call a Large Language Model (LLM) via LangChain in Python.\nStep 1: Install Python Package\nFor instance, for OpenAI LLMs, you need to install the OpenAI library.\n!pip install openai\nStep 2: Get API Key\nGet an API key for the corresponding large language module. You can access some LLMs without an API key. The following script imports OpenAI API key from the environment variables.\nimport os api_key = os.getenv('OpenAI_KEY')\nStep 3: Import LLM Model\nImport an LLM model from LangChain. For example, we import the OpenAI model in the following script. Sometimes, you need to initialize an LLM model using its API key.\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0.9)\nStep 4: Pass Prompt\nPass the prompt to the LLM object you just created.\nprompt = \"Suggest me a good name for an ice cream parlour that is located on a beach!\" print(llm(prompt))\nAnd that’s it. You can see how simple it is to call an LLM with LangChain. You can replace OpenAI with other LangChain-supported large language models.\nLet’s now see what other functionalities you can achieve with LangChain modules.\nLangChain Modules\nLangChain groups its functionalities into modules enlisted below:\nModels\nPrompts\nChains\nAgents\nMemory\nDocument Loaders and Indexes\nModels\nLangChain supports three types of models:\nLarge Language Models\nChat Models\nText Embedding Models\nLarge Language Models\nLarge language models (LLMs) are the simplest of LangChain models and are the backbone of many other LangChain modules. An LLM takes user inputs as texts and outputs a response as text.\nLangChain supports a large number of LLMs. We will see a couple of examples in this section.\nOpenAI Example\nI have already explained in the basic example section how to use OpenAI LLM. If you want to learn more about directly accessing OpenAI functionalities, check out our OpenAI Python Tutorial.\nLet’s dig a little further into using OpenAI in LangChain.\nYou can pass an OpenAI model name to the OpenAI model from the langchain.llms module. In the following example, we pass the text-davinci-003 model, which is also the default model.\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, model_name=\"text-davinci-003\") print(llm(\"Can you tell me a riddle about water?\"))\nYou can pass multiple text prompts to an OpenAI model via the generate() method. For example, the following script returns two outputs, one for each prompt.\nllm_result = llm.generate([\"Write a poem about hills\", \"Tell me a riddle about oranges\"]) len(llm_result.generations)\nYou can access the first output using the generations[0][0].text code.\nprint(llm_result.generations[0][0].text)\nLikewise, generations[1][0].text returns the second output.\nprint(llm_result.generations[1][0].text)\nC Transformers Example\nC transformers package implements various LLMs that you can use in LangChain. You do not need an API key to access C transformers LLMs.\nTo use the C transformers language models in LangChain, you must import the CTransformers model and pass the model name to the model attribute. You can then generate text using CTransformers LLM.\nfrom langchain.llms import CTransformers llm = CTransformers(model='marella/gpt-2-ggml') print(llm(\"I am flying to Lisbon on\"))\nChat Models\nLangChain chat models use LLMs at the backend. However, they allow conversational interaction with users.\nGenerating a Single Response\nTo create a chat model, import one of the LangChain-supported chat models, from the langchain.chat_models module. In the following example, we import the ChatOpenAI model, which uses OpenAI LLM at the backend.\nYou also need to import HumanMessage and SystemMessage objects from the langchain.schema module. The former allows you to specify human/user input, while the latter helps you define the system’s/chat bots role.\nNext, you must create an object of the ChatOpenAI model and pass it your API key. I set the temperature to 0 in the following script since I want the best response. Increasing the temperature will allow the model to generate more creative responses.\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.schema import ( HumanMessage, SystemMessage) chat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0)\nTo create a human or a system message, you need to pass the message text to the content attribute of the HumanMesssage and SystemMessage objects, respectively. You must pass messages in a list to the chat model. It is not mandatory to pass system messages.\nWe pass a single human message to the OpenAI chat model in the following script.\nhuman_message = \"Translate from English to Frech: I love playing Tennis\" chat([HumanMessage(content = human_message)])\nThough you can pass anything to the system messages, you will primarily use it to define the system role. Here’s an example.\nmessages = [ SystemMessage(content=\"You are a football historian.\"), HumanMessage(content=\" Who won the player of the tournament in the 11th Fifa World Cup?\") ] chat(messages)\nGenerating Batch Responses\nYou can generate batch responses from chat models. To do so, you must pass a list containing human and system messages.\nbatch_messages = [ [ SystemMessage(content=\"You are a football historian.\"), HumanMessage(content=\" Who won the player of the tournament in the 11th Fifa World Cup?\") ], [ SystemMessage(content=\"You are a Pizza chef.\"), HumanMessage(content=\"Give me the 7-step recipe to prepare a pizza.\") ], ] result = chat.generate(batch_messages)\nAs with language models, you can access multiple responses using generations list. For instance, you can access the first response via the following script.\nprint(result.generations[0][0].text)\nThe following script prints the second response.\nprint(result.generations[1][0].text)\nText Embedding Models\nThe LangChain text embedding models return numeric representations of text inputs that you can use to train statistical algorithms such as machine learning models.\nYou have to import an embedding model from the langchain.embeddings module and pass the input text to the embed_query() method. The following script uses the OpenAIEmbeddings model to generate text embeddings. The output will be a 1536-dimensional vector.\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key = api_key) text = \"Paris the capital of france and is famous for its wines and perfumes\" embeddings_result = embeddings.embed_query(text) print(len(embeddings_result))\nYou can pass multiple text inputs in a list to embed_documents() method, which returns embeddings for all the text inputs. For example, the following script returns embeddings for three text inputs.\ntext = [\"Paris the capital of france and is famous for its wines and perfumes\", \"London is the Capital of England\", \"Tokyo is the Capital of Japan\" ] embeddings_result = embeddings.embed_documents(text) print(\"Total Embeddings:\", len(embeddings_result))\nIn the next section, I will show you how to replace your hard-coded input templates with something more generic using the LangChain prompts module.\nPrompts\nPrompts refer to model inputs. You hardcoded your prompts to LLMs and chat models in the previous sections. This technique is unsuitable as you will not receive hardcoded complete text prompts in production environments. Instead, you will receive concise inputs from users that you will want to convert to prompts.\nThe LangChain prompts modules let you construct your input prompts in different formats.\nThis section will explain how to format prompts for LLMs and chat models.\nLLM Prompts\nTo create a prompt, import the PromptTemplate object from the langchain.prompts module.\nNext, you need to define a template for your prompt. A prompt template consists of a text string that takes input parameters from the end user and generates a prompt. Inside templates, curly braces contain parameter values.\nYou must pass the template to the template parameter of the PromptTemplate object. You also need to pass the list of parameter names from your template to the input_variables attribute.\nYou can create your final prompt by calling the PromptTemlate’s format() method and passing the value for the input variable.\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = \"Can you tell me a riddle about {object} with its answer?\" prompt = PromptTemplate( template = template, input_variables=[\"object\"] ) prompt = prompt.format(object=\"ice\") print(prompt)\nYou can use the prompt as input to an LLM model.\nllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key) print(llm(prompt))\nChat Prompts\nTo create chat prompts, import ChatPromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, and HumanMessageChatTemplate objects.\nTo create the system chat prompt templates, pass text strings containing input parameters inside the braces to the SystemMessagePromptTemplate object. Likewise, you must pass text strings to the HumanMessageChatTemplates to create human chat prompts.\nOnce you create the system and human prompt templates, you must pass them in a list to the from_messages() attribute of the ChatPrompTemplate object, which combines human and system templates.\nNext, to generate the final template, you must call the format_prompt() method and pass parameter values for the system and human prompt templates.\nfrom langchain.prompts.chat import ( ChatPromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) system_template = \"You are a {sports} historian.\" system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template) human_template = \"{text}\" human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template) chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt]) chat_prompt = chat_prompt.format_prompt(sports=\"Tennis\", text=\"Who won the Australian Open in 2015\").to_messages() print(chat_prompt)\nAs the following script shows, you can use the generated template as input to any chat model.\nchat(chat_prompt)\nIn the next section, you will see how to execute multiple LangChain modules together using chains.\nChains\nChains allow you to run multiple LangChain modules in conjunction. For example, using a chain, you can run a prompt and an LLM together, saving you from first formatting a prompt for an LLM model and executing it using the model in separate steps.\nLangChain supports three main types of chains:\nSimple LLM Chain\nSequential Chain\nCustom Chain\nSimple LLM Chain\nA simple LLM chain receives user input as a prompt and generates an output using an LLM.\nTo use a simple LLM chain, import LLMChain object from the langchain.chains module. Next, you must pass your input prompt and the LLM model to the prompt and llm attributes of the LLMChain object. The LLMChain’s run() method executes the chain. Here’s an example.\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChainllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0.9) prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"object\", \"location\"], template=\"Suggest me a good name for {object} shop, located on {location}\", ) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) print(chain.run({ 'object': \"clothes\", 'location': \"beach\" }))\nYou can also use simple LLM chains to pass prompts to chat models. To do so, you must pass your chat prompts and chat model to the prompt and llm attributes of the LLMChain.\nsystem_template = \"You are a {sports} historian.\" system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template) human_template = \"{text}\" human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template) chat_prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt]) chat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0) chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt_template) print(chain.run({ 'sports': \"Tennis\", 'text': \"Who won Austrialian Open in 2015?\" }))\nSequential Chain\nA sequential chain allows you to execute multiple chains in a sequence. The SimpleSequentialChain object from the langchain.chains module enables you to create a sequential chain. You need to pass the chains you want to execute in a sequence in a list to the chains attribute of the SimpleSequentialChain object. Like a simple chain, the run() method allows you to execute a sequential chain.\nfrom langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain prompt1 = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"location\"], template=\"Suggest me a good name for a clothing shop, located on {location}\", ) chain1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt1) prompt2 = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"location\"], template=\"Write a catchy tag line for a clothing shop, located on {location}\", ) chain2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt2) overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain1, chain2], verbose=True) # Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain. print(overall_chain.run(\"beach\"))\nCustom Chain\nLangChain provides many chains out of the box. In addition, you can create custom chains with LangChain. To do so, you must follow these steps:\nCreate a class that inherits the Chain class from the langchain.chains.base module. Define input_keys and output_keys properties. The input_keys property stores the input to the custom chain, while the output_keys stores the output of your custom chain. Add the _call() method, which executes when you call the run() method on your custom chain object.\nHere is a script from the official LangChain documentation that defines a custom chain that takes two simple LLM chains as input and concatenates the output of the two input chains. The script returns the concatenation as the output of the custom chain.\nfrom typing import Dict, List from langchain.chains.base import Chain class ConcatenateChain(Chain): chain_1: LLMChain chain_2: LLMChain @property def input_keys(self) -> List[str]: # Union of the input keys of the two chains. all_input_vars = set(self.chain_1.input_keys).union(set(self.chain_2.input_keys)) return list(all_input_vars) @property def output_keys(self) -> List[str]: return ['concat_output'] def _call(self, inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]: output_1 = self.chain_1.run(inputs) output_2 = self.chain_2.run(inputs) return {'concat_output': output_1 + output_2}\nYou can run the above custom chain exactly like a sequential chain.\noverall_chain = ConcatenateChain(chain_1=chain1, chain_2=chain2) print(overall_chain.run(\"beach\"))\nThe following section explains how you can use the agents module to make LLMs access external sources and return results based on a thought process.\nAgents\nLangChain agents involve an LLM to perform the following steps:\nDecide which action to perform, based on the user input or its previous outputs. Perform the action. Observe the output. Repeat the first three steps until it completes the task defined in the user input to the best of its abilities.\nAgents make use of external tools to perform specific actions. LangChain provides many out-of-the-box agent tools. Tools allow LLMs to access various information sources such as Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Python REPL Databases, etc., allowing you to solve complex problems involving accessing external resources.\nLet’s see an example where we will create an agent that accesses Arxiv, a famous portal for pre-publishing research papers. We will request the agent to return some information about a research paper.\nTo create an agent that accesses tools, import the load_tools, initialize_agent methods, and AgentType object from the langchain.agents module.\nPass the tool you want an agent to access in a list to the load_tools() method. Next, initialize an agent by passing the tool, LLM, and agent type to the initialize_agent() method. We set verbose = True to view the decision-making process of the agent.\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0.0) tools = load_tools( [\"arxiv\"], ) agent_chain = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, )\nThe initiaize_agent() method returns an object you can execute like a chain via the run() method.\nIn the following example, we ask the agent to return information about a specific paper from Arxiv.\nagent_chain.run( \"What's the paper 2303.15056 about?\", )\nIn the output, you can see the action and the agent’s steps to return the output. It first decides to take action to access Arxic to search the paper. It then searches the paper using the input. It receives the observation and formulates the final output.\nLangChain provides many agents out of the box to perform some of the common tasks. Let’s see an example of an agent that can access Pandas DataFrame.\nFor example, we will request the agent to return information from this Pandas DataFrame.\nimport pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(r'D:Datasetstitanic_data.csv') df.head()\nTo create an agent for Pandas DataFrame, import the create_pandas_dataframe_agent object from the langchain.agents module.\nYou can then directly request the agent via the run() method. For instance, in the following script, we ask the agent to return the mean value from the fare column.\nfrom langchain.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(llm, df, verbose=True) agent.run(\"What is the average Fare?\")\nSimilarly, we can execute more complex queries, and the agent will return the response and the reasoning process involved in response generation.\nagent.run(\"Count the male pessengers with age greater than 50.\")\nIn the next section, you will see how to use LangChain memory agents to track previous user interactions.\nMemory\nBy default, chains and agents treat each incoming query independently and do not keep a record of the previous user interactions. In some applications, for example, in chatbots, it is essential to keep track of previous user interactions.\nThe two most common methods to execute interaction involving memory are chains that store memory at run time and chains that use saved memories. Let’s see both these methods.\nConversation Chains\nConversations chains save all user interactions in memory and generate future responses based on the user’s interactions.\nThe ConversationChain object allows you to create conversation chains. Here is an example: I first say hi to the conversation chain, which generates a response.\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain( llm=llm, verbose = True ) conversation.predict(input=\"Hi there.\")\nNext, I ask it another question. You can see previous interactions in the output of the following script in the “Current conversation” section.\nconversation.predict(input=\"I have a question about Pizza\")\nSimilarly, when I ask another question, it keeps track of all the previous interactions in the “Current conversation” section and generates a response based on the earlier interactions.\nconversation.predict(input=\"Can I make it without an Oven?\")\nUsing Saved Memory\nYou can save your interactions with an LLM, chain, or agent in a ConversationBufferMemory object. You can add user messages via the add_user_message() method and AI/system messages using the add_ai_message() method.\nYou can use the load_memory_variables() method to see all the messages in the memory.\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(\"hi!\") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(\"whats up?\") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(\"I want to know something about Pizza\") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(\"Sure, what do you want to know?\") memory.load_memory_variables({})\nYou can pass the ConversationBufferMemory object to the memory attribute of the ConversationChain object. This allows conversation chains to generate responses based on the interaction in the memory object.\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key = api_key, temperature=0.0) conversation = ConversationChain( llm=llm, memory=memory, verbose = True ) conversation.predict(input=\"Can I make it in Oven?\")\nIn the next section, I will explain how you can import text documents from various sources and use LLM models to analyze and extract information from the documents.\nDocument Loaders and Indexes\nThe LangChain document loader modules allow you to import documents from various sources such as PDF, Word, JSON, Email, Facebook Chat, etc.\nThe following script demonstrates how to import a PDF document using the PyPDFLoader object from the langchain.document module.\n# !pip install pypdf from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader loader = PyPDFLoader(r\"D:Datasets207416.pdf\") documents = loader.load()\nOnce you import a document, you can use the indexes to analyze and extract information from a document. To do so, you need to perform the following steps:\nSplit the document into smaller chunks using one of the LangChain text splitters. Use one of the LangChain text embedding models to get the numerical representation of the document text.\nCreate one of the Langchain vectorstores objects. A vector store is a vector database that stores and index vector embeddings.\nLet’s see an example where we will extract information from a PDF document containing condensed interim financial information of a company.\nWe have already imported the PDF document in a previous script. The following script splits the data into chunks.\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\nThe script below uses a Chroma vector object and calls the from_documents() method to create a vector database. Notice that we pass text chunks and OpenAI embedding objects created in a previous section to the from_documents() method.\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)retriever = db.as_retriever()\nThe as_retreiver() method returns a retriever object for the PDF document.\nDepending on the type of information you want to extract, you can create a chain object and the retriever object from the vector database.\nFor instance, for questions/answers about a document, you can use the RetrievalQA chain from the langchain.chains module.\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=retriever)\nWe will ask a few questions about the PDF document we just imported. Here is what a condensed interim statement of financial position looks like.\nLet’s ask the model to give us the total value of non-current assets. The output shows that the model successfully retrieves this information.\nquery = \"Give me the value of total non current assets\" qa.run(query)\nLet’s get the value of long-term loans and advances.\nquery = \"Give me the value of Long-term loans and advances\" qa.run(query)\nYou can ask further complex questions from the model and it will try to look for the different parts in the document to generate a response.\nFor example, you can ask the model to calculate various financial ratios from the document and explain how it calculated these values.\nquery = \"\"\"Which financial ratios can you calculate from the document? Give values with an explanation for the rations that you can calculate.\"\"\" print(qa.run(query))\nLangChain modules provide a powerful and efficient way to perform various LLM tasks. In the following sections, I will enlist some alternatives to LangChain and answer some of the most frequently asked questions about LangChain.\nLangChain Alternatives\nFollowing are some frameworks providing functionalities similar to LangChain:\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Popular Is LangChain?\nAs of 3rd June 2023, LangChain has 516,737 weekly downloads and falls in the category of influential projects.

    "maintext": "In a bizarre incident that occurred in broad daylight on the premises of the Qaisarbagh Sessions Court in UP’s capital Lucknow, Sanjeev Maheshwari aka ‘Jeeva’, a close associate of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, was shot dead.\nAccording to reports, ‘Jeeva’ was brought to the POCSO court for a hearing related to a sub-judice matter when unidentified assailants, disguised as lawyers, opened fire at him.\nIn a redux of sorts, Atiq Ahmed and his brother had been killed by assailants posing as journalists.\nDuring the attack, a police officer also suffered gunshot wound to his leg. While ‘Jeeva’ succumbed on the spot, the injured officer was immediately rushed for emergency medical treatment.\n#WATCH | Uttar Pradesh: Gangster Sanjeev Jeeva shot outside the Lucknow Civil Court. Further details awaited (Note: Abusive language) pic.twitter.com/rIWyxtLuC4 — ANI UP/Uttarakhand (@ANINewsUP) June 7, 2023\n‘Jeeva’ was closely associated with Mukhtar Ansari and was a co-accused in two high-profile murder cases. On Monday, Ansari himself was sentenced to life imprisonment in a 32-year-old Awadesh Rai murder case. Rai was a Congress MLA when he was gunned down in Varanasi.\nPrevious cases involving ‘Jeeva’ include the murder of Krishnananda Rai, a BJP MLA from the Mohammadabad assembly constituency in Ghazipur. Along with six others, Rai was attacked by a group of assailants armed with AK-47 assault rifles. Over 400 bullet shells were found at the crime scene, with 21 bullets retrieved from Rai’s body.\nThe incident took place on November 29, 2005, when Rai’s convoy was ambushed at a narrow bridge in the Ussarchati locality of Bhawarkol area in Ghazipur.\nAnother case linked to Maheshwari ‘Jeeva’ is the Brahm Dutt Dwivedi murder case from 1997. Dwivedi, an MLA of the BJP at the time, was killed. Dutt was famous for having protected former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati from Samajwadi Party members during the infamous Guest House incident.\nRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News,\nIndia News and Entertainment News here.

    "maintext": "To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans, we'll remember five of the weirdest cars that ever competed.\nCadillac \"Le Monstre\"\nPhoto: Revs Institute\nOHV\nNardi Bisiluro\nPhoto: Ufficine Nardi SpA\nRover-BRM\nPhoto: Jaguar Land Rover\nChaparral 2F\nPhoto: Lothar Spurzem via Wikimedia Commons\nDeltaWing\nPhoto: Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.\nSince the first edition held in 1923, the world's oldest, most prestigious endurance race has been a testbed for automotive innovations Whether they desperately wanted to win or just prove the viability of their ideas, the brightest minds in motorsport have continually introduced new designs and technologies at the Circuit de La Sarthe.Many of these innovations caught on and influenced the evolution of race and road cars, while others gave birth to some weird yet wonderful cars that stood out from the rest.For this year's edition, Cadillac is set to return to Le Mans with its state-of-the-art V-Series.R prototype. GM's luxury division debuted at the famed 24-hour race in 1950 thanks to American entrepreneur, driver, and team owner Briggs Cunningham.The story goes that Cunningham's close friend and three-times Le Mans winner , Luigi Chinetti, challenged him to enter two American cars in the French race.Chinetti went as far as obtaining an invite for his friend, who assembled a private team and decided to race a couple of Cadillac Series 61 coupes powered by the division's mighty 331-ci (5.4-liter)V8. While the first car was more or less stock, the second received a completely wild body.Back then, the Le Mans rulebook didn't allow competitors to swap the car's factory engines, but it gave them the freedom to basically rebody their vehicles. Therefore, to shed weight and improve aerodynamics, Cunningham recruited aeronautical engineer Howard Weinman who designed a new body. While it looked inspired by a tank , the new structure was developed using a wind tunnel meant for testing small aircraft fuselages.Nicknamed \"Le Monstre\" (the monster) by the French crowd, the modified Caddy performed well at the 1950 race despite several drawbacks. Co-driven by Phil Walters and Briggs Cunningham himself, it finished 11th overall, ahead of much more prestigious sports cars such as the Jaguar XK120s.If you're a fan of vintage Italian sports cars, Nardi is a familiar name. The company produced wooden steering wheels for a series of legendary cars, including the Ferrari 250 GTO But apart from exquisite steering wheels, Enrico Nardi, the man behind the company, also designed a series of wild vehicles based on Fiat chassis and powered by motorcycle engines.By far the wildest and most famous of them all was the Nardi Bisiluro (twin torpedo, in Italian), also known as the Nardi 750 Bisiluro or Damolnar - an acronym for Damonte, Molino, and Nardi, the people behind the project.Built on a Fiat 500 chassis, the four-wheeled oddity featured an asymmetric twin torpedo-like body with the cockpit on the right and a 55-hp, Giannini-tuned, 735cc BMW motorcycle four-cylinder engine hidden inside the left \"torpedo.\"The car started the 1955 Le Mans race as Ufficine Nardi's only factory entry, but it only lasted about an hour as an accident forced it to retire.Despite its early exit, the Nardi Bisiluro went down in history as the weirdest car to ever compete in the legendary endurance race, a title it still holds nearly five decades later.Although it was never as weird-looking as the other cars in this article, the Rover-BRM was unquestionably one of the most peculiar vehicles to ever race at Le Mans because it featured a jet engine.Shortly after the Second World War ended, several carmakers started experimenting with gas-turbine technology, which proved its worth during the global conflict in the aircraft industry.The first carmaker to build a functional, gas turbine-powered car was Rover, who introduced a prototype named JET1 in the spring of 1950. Over the next decade, the company developed several other, more advanced concept cars that utilized this technology. One of these cars ran a few demonstration laps before the start of the 1962 Le Mans race, and the crowd's positive reaction convinced the organizers to give Rover a shot at competing in the next edition.Thus, Rover partnered with Formula 1 team British Racing Motors (BRM) and developed a gas turbine-powered racing prototype, which was entered in the 1963 Le Mans race as an experimental entry.Rather uninspiringly named Rover-BRM, the jet car surprised everyone and finished the race ahead of the 7th-placed AC Cobra Hardtop, but since it was an experimental entry, the result didn't officially count.With several improvements, the car returned to Le Mans in 1964 and 1965 . While the 1964 adventure was cut short by mechanical issues, the jet-powered car finished the race tenth in 1965 and did so as an official entry in the 2-liter prototype class.A Group 6 sports prototype designed by Jim Hall and Hap Sharp, the Chaparral 2F was not built exclusively for the Le Mans race, but targeted the 1965 World Sportscar Championship crown.Built around a bespoke semi-monocoque chassis, it was powered by a 526-hp, 427-ci (7.0-liter) Chevy \"Porcupine\" big-block V8 mated to a three-speed automatic.The 2F's fiberglass bodywork was, in many ways, an aerodynamic masterpiece, yet its boxy rear end and huge, high-rise rear spoiler made it look extremely goofy. However, the spoiler, which was controlled via an extra pedal inside the cockpit, made the race car one of the very first to use active aerodynamics.While the aerodynamic innovations proved their worth and influenced future motorsport designs, the 2F was plagued by mechanical issues, and its season ended up being a disaster.At the 1965 edition of Le Mans, Chaparral fielded two cars among the sea of Fords and Ferraris. Unfortunately, neither could cross the finish line, retiring with gearbox (car nr. 7) and electrical system failures (car nr. 8).The most radical race car designs of the 21st century, the DeltaWing project started out as a proposal for IndyCar's next-gen chassis.The brainchild of British race car designer and engineer Ben Bowlby, it was unveiled at the 2010 Chicago Auto Show, showcasing a new design principle that dramatically lowered weight, reduced drag, and improved fuel consumption, allowing it to perform like some of the most powerful race cars around while using a much smaller engine.The idea drew a lot of interest, but the unconventional design didn't impress IndyCar officials, who ultimately decided to go with a new Dallara chassis.Nevertheless, the team behind the project didn't give up. It partnered with Japanese giants Nissan , who delivered a bespoke, 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and decided to race at Le Mans in 2012 as an experimental, Garage 56 entry.In France, it proved that it could hang with the big boys and showcased its impressive fuel efficiency. Unfortunately, it only survived 75 laps, having to retire because of an accident.",

    "maintext": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\nAs millions of newcomers have flocked to the Las Vegas Valley over the past 50 years, every level of government in the nation’s driest state has worked to ensure that water shortages don’t stop the growth.\nSince 1999, southern Nevada has ripped out thousands of acres of turf from lawns, sports fields and roadway medians under the West’s most ambitious grass-removal program. These efforts helped halve the amount of water each resident consumed and freed up enough for Clark County to add nearly 1 million people.\nNow, the valley is again looking to grass removal to continue growing without increasing its overall water use. In 2021, the Nevada Legislature passed a first-of-its-kind law mandating the elimination of “nonfunctional turf,” defined as grass that is decorative and rarely used. The Southern Nevada Water Authority promised this would do away with 3,900 acres of grass (roughly 3,000 football fields) within six years.\nBut by analyzing the water authority’s own aerial imagery, ProPublica found that the agency grossly overestimated how much of that grass could be removed: That number could actually be as low as 1,100 acres. That error, combined with pushback to the ban — especially from homeowners associations looking to avoid turf removal costs and preserve their communities’ aesthetic — could leave the region short of the water savings it needs.\nThis comes at a precarious time. The Colorado River, which supplies 90% of the Las Vegas Valley’s water, has been hit by a megadrought, and Lake Mead has fallen to historic lows. The agriculture industry uses the vast majority of the dwindling river, but Las Vegas and other cities that also rely on the Colorado must scramble to find savings. Meanwhile, the federal government is mulling drastic cuts to their water supply.\nAs other Western states try to replicate southern Nevada’s water conservation success, the diminishing returns from its marquee program have experts questioning whether the effort will be enough to support continued growth in a hotter, drier future.\n“Get rid of Denver, Salt Lake, Las Vegas, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Tucson — the whole nine yards — and you still would not reach the amount of water you need to save,” Colby Pellegrino, the water authority’s deputy general manager of resources, told ProPublica. “As a basin, the answer is not lying within the entire urban sector. There has to be participation from agriculture and industrial.”\nSome HOAs already see the limits of this strategy. After years of minimizing the water used on landscaping, staff members at Sun City Anthem, a retirement community of more than 10,000 people in Henderson, say they’ve run out of nonfunctional turf to remove. All that’s left is a lawn they want to keep for events like movie nights.\n“That was the end,” said Larry Fossan, the community’s facilities manager and landscape supervisor. “We can’t save any more water.”\nAs Fossan passed through a common area where elderly residents were socializing, a woman glanced up from a game of mahjong and asked suspiciously, “Are you taking more grass?”\nWhere’s the Turf?\nEach year, southern Nevada is allotted 300,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water, which SNWA supplements with about 47,000 acre-feet of groundwater from beneath the Las Vegas Valley. (An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply two to three homes per year.) But impending cuts to allocations from the river could bring southern Nevada dangerously close to exceeding its supply.\nProjections show by 2035 Clark County’s population will grow 27% to nearly 3 million people. Without cuts to water use, the larger population will require about 400,000 acre-feet a year — far more than it is entitled to use. To meet the demand, it must reduce future water use by more than 100,000 acre-feet.\nThe plan to get the savings relies in large part on reducing grass. It’s a strategy the water authority has leaned on for decades. Rather than just urging residents to take shorter showers or run only full loads of laundry, it has consistently looked for water savings outdoors. That’s because the agency already treats and recycles virtually all water used indoors. It sends that water back to Lake Mead, earning “return-flow credits,” which allow it to draw an equal amount from the reservoir.\nBut water applied to landscaping can’t be recouped. It either evaporates or soaks into the ground instead of returning to Lake Mead. So, in 1999, the water agency created a program to pay residents a one-time incentive to remove their lawns.\nLater, the water authority and its members — Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and several water districts — restricted the size of lawns in new developments and increased financial incentives to rip out existing turf at homes and businesses, significantly reducing outdoor water use.\nTurf Removal in Las Vegas Stalled after the 2000s… …Despite Increasing Cash Incentives to Rip Out Grass * Incentives are adjusted for inflation.\nBut once the easy-to-get grass was gone, the water savings dwindled.\n“Some of these larger nonresidential users — everybody from HOAs to office parks — didn’t seem to be interested in taking advantage of the voluntary system,” Assemblyman Howard Watts, a Las Vegas Democrat, said.\nSo Watts jumped at the water authority’s idea for a legislative mandate to remove nonfunctional turf. Together, they sold the Nevada Legislature on the premise that such a ban could save nearly a quarter of the water needed to supply the expected population growth.",

    "maintext": "For Taylor Arnold, a registered dietitian nutritionist, feeding her second baby was not easy. At eight weeks old, he screamed when he ate and wouldn’t gain much weight. Arnold brought him to a gastroenterologist, who diagnosed him with allergic proctocolitis — an immune response to the proteins found in certain foods, which she narrowed down to cow’s milk.\nCow’s milk protein allergies, or CMPA, appear to be on the rise — following a similar trend to other children’s food allergies — and they can upend a caregiver’s feeding plans: A breastfeeding parent is often told to eliminate dairy from their diet, or switch to a specialized hypoallergenic formula, which can be expensive.\nBut while the evidence suggests that CMPA rates are climbing, the source of that increase remains unclear. Some experts say part of the reason is that doctors are getting better at recognizing symptoms. Others claim the condition is overdiagnosed, which could have health consequences, such as an increased risk of developing additional allergies later in life. And among those who believe that milk allergy rates are inflated, some suspect the global formula industry, valued at $55 billion according to a 2022 report from the World Health Organization and UNICEF, may have an undue influence.\nMeanwhile, “no one has ever studied these kids in a systematic way,” said Victoria Martin, a pediatric gastroenterologist and allergy researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s pretty unusual in disease that is this common, that has been going on for this long, that there hasn’t been more careful, controlled study.”\nThis lack of clarity can leave doctors in the dark about how to diagnose the condition and leave parents with more questions than answers about how best to treat it.\nWhen Arnold’s son became sick with CMPA symptoms, it was “really, really stressful,” she told Undark. Plus, “I didn’t get a lot of support from the doctors, and that was frustrating.”\nThough the gastroenterologist recommended she switch to formula, Arnold ultimately used a lactation consultant and gave up dairy so she could continue breastfeeding. But she said she can understand why others might not make the same choice: “A lot of moms go to formula because there’s not a lot of support for how to manage the diet.”\nFood allergies primarily come in two forms: One, called an IgE-mediated allergy, has symptoms that appear soon after ingesting a food — such as swelling, hives, or difficulty breathing — and may be confirmed by a skin prick test. The second, which Arnold’s son was diagnosed with, is a non-IgE-mediated allergy or food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, and is much harder to diagnose.\nWith non-IgE allergies, symptom onset often doesn’t happen immediately after a person eats a triggering food and there is no test to confirm a diagnosis. (Some specialists don’t like to call the condition an allergy because it doesn’t present with classic allergy symptoms.) Instead, physicians often rely on past training, online resources, or published guidelines written by experts in the field, which list symptoms and help doctors make a treatment plan.\nNumerous such guidelines exist to help providers diagnose milk allergies, but the process is not always straightforward. “It’s a perfect storm” of vague and common symptoms and no diagnostic test, said Adam Fox, a pediatric allergist and a professor at King’s College London, noting that commercial interests such as formula company marketing can also be misleading. “It’s not really a surprise that you’ve got confused patients and, frankly, a lot of very confused doctors.”\n“It’s pretty unusual in disease that is this common, that has been going on for this long, that there hasn’t been more careful, controlled study,” said Victoria Martin, a pediatric gastroenterologist.\nFox is the lead author of the International Milk Allergy in Primary Care, or iMAP, guidelines, one of many similar documents intended to help physicians diagnose CMPA. But some guidelines, including iMAP — which was known as the Milk Allergy in Primary Care Guideline until 2017 — have been criticized for listing a broad range of symptoms, like colic, non-specific rashes, diarrhea, and constipation, which can be common in healthy infants during the first year of their life.\n“Lots of babies cry, or they posset, or they get a little minor rash or something,” said Michael Perkin, a pediatric allergist based in the U.K. “But that doesn’t mean they’ve got a pathological process going on.”\nIn a paper published online in December 2021, Perkin and colleagues found that in a food allergy trial, nearly three-quarters of the infants’ parents reported at least two symptoms that matched iMAP guideline’s “mild-moderate” non-IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy symptoms, such as vomiting or reflux. But another study led by Perkin and Robert Boyle, a children’s allergy specialist at Imperial College London, reviewed available evidence and found that only about 1 percent of babies have a milk allergy proven by what’s called a “food challenge,” in which a person is exposed to the allergen and their reactions are monitored.\nThat same study found that up to 14 percent of families believe their babies have a milk allergy. Meanwhile, another study by Boyle and colleagues showed that milk allergy formula prescriptions increased 2.8-fold in England from 2007 to 2018. Researchers at the University of Rochester found similar trends stateside: Between 2017 and 2019, hypoallergenic formula sales rose from 4.9 percent to 7.6 percent of all formula sold in the U.S.\nPerkin and Boyle suspect the formula industry has influenced diagnosis guidelines. In their 2020 report, which was published in JAMA Pediatrics, they found that 81 percent of authors who wrote nine physicians’ guidelines for the condition — including the 2013 version of the iMAP guidelines — reported a conflict of interest with formula manufacturers, such as research funding, consulting fees, or paid lectures.\nSupport Undark Magazine Undark is a non-profit, editorially independent magazine covering the complicated and often fractious intersection of science and society.

One recent study found that around 85 percent of pediatricians surveyed reported a representative visit, sometimes sponsoring meals.\nFormula companies “like people getting the idea that whenever a baby cries, or does a runny poo, or anything,” that it might be a milk allergy, Boyle said.\nIn response to criticism that the guidelines have influenced the increase in specialized formula sales, Fox noted that the rise began in the early 2000s. One of the first diagnosis guidelines, meanwhile, was published in 2007. He also said that the symptoms listed in the iMAP guidelines were taken from the U.K.’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the U.S.’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nAs for the conflicts of interest, Fox said: “We never made any money from this, there was never any money for the development of it. We’ve done this with best intentions, we absolutely recognize where that may not have turned out the way that we intended it, we’d have tried our best to address that.”\nFormula companies “like people getting the idea that whenever a baby cries, or does a runny poo, or anything,” that it might be a milk allergy, Boyle said.\nFollowing backlash over close ties between the formula industry and healthcare professionals, including author conflicts of interest, iMAP updated their guidelines in 2019. The new version responded directly to criticism and said the guidelines received no direct industry funding, but acknowledged “a potential risk of unconscious bias” related to research funding, educational grants, and consultant fees. The authors noted that the new guidelines tried to mitigate such influence through independent patient input.\nFox also said he ceased all formula ties in 2018, and led the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology to do the same when he was president.\nUndark reached out to the Infant Nutrition Council of America, an association of the largest U.S. manufacturers of infant formula, multiple times, but did not receive any comment in response.\nThough the guidelines have issues, said Nigel Rollins, a pediatrician and researcher at the World Health Organization, he sees the rise in diagnoses as driven by formula industry marketing to parents, which can fuel the idea that fussiness or colic might be signs of a milk allergy. Parents then go to their pediatrician to talk about milk allergy, Rollins said, and “the family doctor isn’t actually well-positioned to argue otherwise.”\nRollins led much of the research in the 2022 report from WHO and UNICEF, which surveyed more than 8,500 pregnant and postpartum people in eight countries (not including the U.S.). Of those participants, 51 percent were exposed to aggressive formula milk marketing, which the report states “represents one of the most underappreciated risks to infants and young children’s health.”\nMeanwhile, Amy Burris, a pediatric allergist and immunologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said there are many likely causes of overdiagnosis. “I don’t know that there’s one particular thing that stands out in my head as the reason it’s overdiagnosed,” she added.\nSome physicians rely on their own criteria for diagnosing non-IgE milk allergy, rather than the guidelines — for instance, conducting a test that detects microscopic blood in stool. But Burris and Rollins both pointed out that healthy infants, or infants who have recently had a virus or stomach bug, can have traces of blood in their stool, too.\nMartin, the allergy researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the better way to confirm an infant dairy allergy is to reintroduce milk around a month after it has been eliminated: If the symptoms reappear, then the baby most likely has the allergy. The guidelines say to do this, but both Martin and Perkin told Undark that this almost never happens; parents can be reluctant to reintroduce a food if their baby seems better without it.\n“I wish every physician followed the guidelines right now until we write better guidelines, because, unequivocally, what folks are doing not following the guidelines is worse,” Martin said, adding that kids are on a restricted diet for a longer time than they should be.\nGiving up potentially allergenic foods, including dairy, isn’t without consequences. “I think there’s a lot of potential risk in having moms unnecessarily avoid cow’s milk or other foods,” Burris said. “Also, you’re putting the breastfeeding relationship at risk.”\nBy the time Burris sees a baby, she said, their mother has often already given up breastfeeding after a primary care provider suggested a food allergy, but “at that point, it’s too late to restimulate the supply.” It also remains an open question whether allergens in breast milk actually trigger infant allergies. According to Perkin, the amount of cow’s milk protein that enters breast milk is “tiny.”\nFor babies, Martin said, dietary elimination may affect sensitivity to other foods. She pointed to research indicating that early introduction of food allergens such as peanuts can reduce the likelihood of developing allergies.\n“I wish every physician followed the guidelines right now until we write better guidelines, because, unequivocally, what folks are doing not following the guidelines is worse,” Martin said.\nMartin also said some babies with a CMPA diagnosis may not have to give up milk entirely. She led a 2020 study suggesting that even when parents don’t elect to make any dietary changes for babies with a non-IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosis, they later report an improvement in their babies’ symptoms. But when parents do make changes to their baby’s diet, in Martin’s experience, if they later reintroduce milk, “the vast majority of them do fine,” she said. “I think some people would argue that maybe you had the wrong diagnosis initially. But I think the other possibility is that it’s the right diagnosis, it just turns around pretty fast.”\nStill, many parents who give up dairy, or switch to a hypoallergenic formula, report an improvement in their baby’s symptoms. Arnold said her son’s symptoms improved when they eliminated dairy. But when he was about eight months old, they reintroduced the food group to his diet, and he had no issues.\nWhether that’s because the cow’s milk protein allergy was short-lived or because his symptoms were due to something else, it’s unclear. But she sees moms self-diagnosing their baby with food allergies on social media and believes many are experiencing a placebo effect when they say their baby improves. “Nobody’s immune to that. Even me,” she said. “There’s absolutely a chance that that was the case with my baby.”\nChristina Szalinski is a freelance science writer with a Ph.D. in cell biology based near Philadelphia.",
